PLDT,1.1,Bad,#pissedcustomerturnedhappysubscriber,#pissedcustomerturnedhappysubscriberI took me almost a month to get relocated to my new location. I called CSR’s everyday to check on the status of my request but none of them were able to meet my request until such time I went to SM Seaside Cebu to air out my concerns. Ms. Ella (SM Seaside - don’t know her last name) arranged everything and promised to monitor my urgent request. I knew it was vexing complaints coming from me I told her that no CSR’s were taking my request seriously but they only asked for email address and contact number and eventually nothing else happened.  I just want to commend Ms. Ella for doing everything she could with her power. She even called me for countless times for a followup. It took only a day to get my relocation.   Kudos to Ms.Ella.Another persons that I really wanted to commend are the technical people namely; Jose Winston Tilar and Ronaldo Besin ( Mandaue Team ) for taking an immediate action on my request. At that time   of installation it was raining cats and dogs but it didn’t stop them from doing it. It took them more than an hour to get the job done. They both get partially drenched on that day but did it with safety measures. YOU GUYS WERE AWESOME! A Million Thanks to you!,4,7-Jul-21,1,PH,NULL,Jul,7,2021

If you can’t commit the volumes then don’t. You’re not just hurting your own reputation, you’re affecting the local sellers’ as well.

Lazada,1.5,Bad,"11/6/18 Cannot recommend Lazada, better to stay away from them as far as possible.","11/6/18On 23rd of September 2018 i had ordered a flat screen television, a wall bracket and an antenna from Lazada, as a gift for my parents in law. Order Number 207570108682693. Delivery of these 3 items happened after one week with a cracked screen on the tv. Firstly I was not able to return the item because Lazada website was hiding the return button for the tv, It took me 5 days of another daily chat with customer care until the return button was displayed on their website and i could request a return after 5 days of chat!!!. Total return warranty of the item was 7 days. The antenna and the wall bracket had a return button at all the times, but they were not broken... However, this order and the attempt to return was a lot of hassle already.So then after the broken tv was returned, i ordered a new tv from Lazada, as a replacement, order number 208939138482693, for the double price than before, delivery fee 4 times increased than before. Today as of the 6th of November, the replacement has not been delivered yet. Daily chat with customer care since 26th of october again and again turned into no results. Obviously their customer care doesnt care about anything, at all. Sorry but after all this experiences i can only recommend to stay away from Lazada as far as possible. Question to Lazada: Will you ever deliver the television or should i just contact my credit card company and cancel the payment? Thanks.",1,6-Nov-18,2,DE,NULL,Nov,11,2018

Lazada,1.5,Bad,Lazada's Inability to Return Grocery Money Amidst Covid-19 Situation,"3 weeks ago, amidst the Covid-19 situation and because we did not want to risk going out, I decided I entrust Lazada for all our grocery essentials, as I have done in the past. I filled up my shopping cart with all that we would need (rice, dairies, etc) and was ready to checkout, so I Cashed-in into my Lazada wallet for a big sum of P23,000 ($500).When I was checking out, Lazada system gave out a system error, saying apologies as there were issues in the system. The error message was meaningless so I escalated and learned that the real reason was that Lazada has stopped servicing our location. I would have understood that except now, nobody could help return my money back into my bank account.The past 3 weeks, I have been chatting with Lazada agents and supervisors almost on a daily basis and have been asking its manager to update me on the progress. The money is intended for food and groceries and 3 weeks is not a short time to wait amidst Covid-19. After 2 weeks of waiting, Manager John advised me that Lazada could not revert the money back and wanted me to go out of the house to pick it up on a remittance center. How inconsiderate is this solution considering that I chose Lazada to buy groceries so that I didnt have to get out of the house.It is also very illogical that, a big company, like Lazada has the mechanism to get our money in but has no mechanism to give it back to us. How bad also that the Lazada system allowed me to fill up my shopping basket and for cashing into my Lazada wallet when it knew it could not deliver to my designated and registered address.I have already given Lazada all the opportunities to help me by talking to possibly more than 20 agents, 5 supervisors and its manager and used up more than 20 hours in chats and calls to have this resolved. Lazada agents have dropped on my chats with them numerous times because and could not keep promises and commitment. After more than 3 weeks, our much-needed grocery money has not been returned yet.",1,11-May-20,1,PH,NULL,May,5,2020

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,4 FAILED PICK UP ATTEMPTS,"4 FAILED PICK UP ATTEMPTSTerrible pick up service and customer service. Highly disappointed and giving customer empty promises.1. Arranged a pick up for 7th Sep between 12 - 3pm and waited the whole day but to no driver picked up the package nor does anyone inform me about the failed pick up.2. Called in to rearrange the pick up and was agreed on a new date and time from 10th Sep between 3-6pm and again, no driver picked up the parcel. This time, at 5:41pm customer service called and the reason is not enough space in their van so suggested to rearranged the pick up (again).3. I agreed to rearranged to next day (11 Sep between 12-3pm) and reminded the customer service representative that this is already the 3rd time and shall be the last time I expected for the re-arrangement of the pick up. HOWEVER, again, no driver picked up and I decided to see and wait until when will they have the courtesy to call or pick up my package. So, a customer support representative called at 6:58pm informing me that, yet again, 'not enough space in our van so we want you to reschedule the pick up service'. So I asked her to justify the reason why a single pick up service can failed for 3 times in a row and she (initial A), insisted that the reason is ""as is and her system already say so"", 1st failed attempt - ""no reason why the 1st driver never arrive but he just never arrive"" and 2nd, ""this is only the 2nd time that the rearrangement was made"" - when I asked her ""if she is sure that this is  the '2nd' time"" - she insisted ""yes very sure because her system reflect that"", even though I told her that this is the 3rd time and I even received 3 telegram messages as well as the call history. The last customer service who attended sounded so pissed off at me when I asked her if she is sure about the number of attempt and she even raised her voice. So, requested for a call back from the manager.Current status - Manager called and gave the same explanation that they have failed attempts and reason is always no space in the van. Apparently, according to his system, the original schedule that I had was 'routed' and means that no driver is available on the day so no one pick up the package and hence, no notification will be sent and it was not even counted as an attempt. He mentioned that the responsibility is only on the freight department as they are responsible for the driver and the arrangement. Who care which department is handling it, you are from the same company, any internal issues you have, you handle it internally and do not cause those issues to affect your customers and making your company look super unprofessional.Latest Update: 13 Sep - 4th Rearrangement (6-10pm) - STILL NO PICK UP IS INITIATED BY NINJAVAN",1,13-Sep-21,2,SG,NULL,Sep,9,2021

Shopee,1.8,Poor,A very bad platform,"A very bad platform, mainly they sided with the seller. Any dispute the refund takes more than 2 weeks and a lot of their vouchers is mostly cashback form that you have to return to buy their other stuff. The live auctions there is horrible too, full of their own people to mock each other and buyer. They have subcontractor for delivery and will push blame to each other when something goes wrong. (Sellers will probably give excuses like they use subcontractors because of Wuhan Virus and lack of manpower, ""250""reply or no response at all) There is not much aftersale service. Bought some of the affordable stuff and it's alright but some mid to high end stuff of the overseas live auctions is quite bad and the sales tactic there is so terrible that it aren't funny, they're try to keep talk you into buying high value items with crappy service. Why would anyone want to continue to take the risk after receiving products that's not up to expectation is beyond me. The postman sometimes don't read the note,if you ask for contactless delivery to minimise virus risk they'll insist of in person, if you ask for in person delivery they'll sometimes do contactless delivery. One time the delivery person rudely put my parcel ""under""the pot outside and the item inside can be easily damaged because I'm sleeping and missed his call. I told him aren't instructions on the note and he say he didn't see. No idea what the note is for if they don't want to read it.*Update:They probably read comments here, now the delivery is slightly better. But the refund procedure is still disastrous. And careful to buy especially from some ""foreign"" sellers or overseas live auctions there, even if you buy ""high value"" items it's a risk when the item have some defects and you want to return/exchange as some can't be reasoned.

Then when they find my number in those miss calls, take screen shot ,place on facebook for all to see.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Completely incompetent,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I took 4 PAL flights within the past 2 weeks, with the last 2 being kuala lumpur to manila, connecting to LAX. All 4 flights were delayed.First off, the behind the counter staff at all 3 airports were awful. They were incredibly slow and chatting with eachother instead of customers. One staff member at LAX before our first flight walked away in the middle of helping us to laugh and joke with another staff member when lines were super long.The WORST and most ridiculous experience was regarding our bags on our connecting flight home. ALWAYS with connecting flights they go straight to the final destination. I've never ever had an issue with this. When we got halfway at manila we had 6 different staff tell us different things. Some told us that we had to go into this gross small basement to find our bags before putting them on our connecting flight. What? This is the airlines' job to make sure our bags go to the right destination, not ours, and there were 7 staff members in this basement just sitting on their phones not bothering to find bags or transfer them. Mind you, since our flight was delayed we got in to manila as our flight was boarding and was scheduled to take off. They couldn't find our bags (or 8 others in the same scenario) and made us wait 25 minutes. Other staff told us we were going to miss our flight even though they were the ones making us wait for our bags for our connecting flight. We never ended up getting our bags in manila because they said they'd take care of it (which they should've done in the first place) and they were rude rushing us, making us sprint to catch our flight that we were going to ""miss"" because of their error. Fast forward to LA. Turns out our bags didn't make the flight. Surprise surprise. The guy said we can pick them up tomorrow night, despite living over 2 hours away. Gee thanks. We convinced them to ship them overnight after they get into LA. We'll see if we actually get them. I've never had an experience like this one during any of my international travel and I'll be sure to never book with PAL again.",1,11-Aug-19,1,US,NULL,Aug,8,2019

No name dropping ( found that other agency from my messenger)  but because it will be my husband’s first time to travel abroad, I saw it proper to check the agency out. Unfortunately, I saw a bad review (scamming) about that agency. I was bent on getting business class tickets. That was when I chanced on Mabuhay Travel. Initially, it was Remy who helped me find out that the other agency was a scammer then she endorsed me to Anne Kepler. Simply put, if I finalized with the other agency, I would have lost a big amount of £s. I am just really grateful to Remy and also Anne Kepler for the excellent service they have provided to ensure that my husband will get the best option, best airline along with the requirements due this pandemic travel.

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE,"As someone who's worked for customer service for more than 10 years and now a business owner, it is quite alarming how Ninjavam doesn't know how to take ownership of issues that are obviously caused by pain points in the process, the value of a future-proof resolution and efficiency.This may sound like a simple issue but it has dragged on for so long which made it much more frustrating. I have made an order through Shopee where I never had issues with my address being tagged as a ""double entry"" as stated by one of their representatives. I have then encountered that issue and was told to just reorder which doesn't really resolve  it because it would again be tagged as a ""double entry"" which the representative refused to understand.  It is like talking to deaf ears.The thing about Shopee's dropdown options for the district is it doesn't include my district so I had no choice but to pick the nearest district which is ""Santa Ana"" and just put ""Sta Mesa"" on the address field so that the driver doesn't get lost. Ninjavan immediately tagged this as a ""double entry"" which makes sense at first but if you do a bit of checking as what other couriers are probably doing because this issue is ISOLATED and applies only to Ninja Van, there is only one ""Illumina Residences"" in Metro Manila so this double entry is not even relevant.Because there was no resolution provided by Ninjavan, all my orders with Ninjavan as the courier has been tagged as returned to sender. I have contact their customer customer service line and spoke to a rep who kept me on hold for a whole hour because he needed to check with a supervisor and when I finally asked to speak with a supervisor, he then place me on hold for a whole hour without going back to check on me from to time to time. He promised a callback from a supervisor which never happened. I wrote an email to their customer service manager and chief operating officer about my experience and was ignored because obviously I do not have any value to them and I am a waste of their time. Why have customer service department if the department doesn’t do the job? The more complaints they get, the bigger chances of Shopee cutting them off.",1,10-Jun-20,3,PH,NULL,Jun,6,2020

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,Bad experience from Flowerstore.ph,"At first, it was smooth sailing, before I ordered, all of my questions were explained and answered promptly. Ordered online and settled it via bank deposit. They acknowledged it and emailed me the reference number and schedule it to be delivered by Feb 13. They said delivery will be between 8 AM to 6PM, I accepted it.Yesterday, Feb 13, disaster starts, I was thrilled to received an email to track my order at around 10 AM. After an hour, I asked them why the tracking link is not updating because it only shows delivery to paranaque at around 12:30 AM, I was advised that their courier will reach out if they are already onsite. After 5 hours of patiently waiting, the item was handed over to their courier, since it was in paranaque I'm expecting it to be delivered by 4 or 5 PM. But since we are in the mall, I asked someone to check outside if my order already arrived but to my surprise items still not delivered. Tried to contact them via mobile but to no avail, tried to message them in messenger but they are not responding, called them via their hotline number but no one's answering. Then at around 6PM, update received from them saying that the courier experienced heavy traffic that is why there will be some delays (motorcycle traffic???), after an hour wala pa rin ung order ko they said ""nasa mckinely na po, pa antay lang"". So, me and my wife went home but from Makati to Taguig we didn't experience heavy traffic, was able to reached our house within 30 minutes. To my anger, I asked for a refund but was advised refund is not allowed because the item is on the way. After 4 hours of waiting and messaging them and making follow ups, my order arrived but it is not the correct item 😔. I asked them to replace it but they said it will not be delivered by Feb 14 (kaya nga bumili para sa valentines) Tried to reached out via messenger, email and fb page but everytime I placed a negative feedback/comment, it was deleted immediately. They want their image to be good but their service is really bad. They blocked me in messenger and fb page so I cannot comment and message them. I've requested for a refund but still not processed. Hopefully the entire amount will be refunded.

Learn to Trade Philippines,4.6,Excellent,Beginners Bootcamp Experience,"Attended for the first time Beginners Bootcamp on April 30, 2021.

I am thankful to LTT because with my UW Gold membership, I can just re-sit If I need to in the same trainings. It is also worth the mention and commendation is the importance of Smartcharts in a trader's work. The AI in Smartchart with its strategies is a great help most specially to newbies just like me. It automates various functions although continuous improvement on its limitations such as inconsistency in the trade signal and indicators in the shorter timeframe would be a good development.So far so good in my journey with LTT.

I'm located in province so I find it weird-then after a day-was tagged as failed delivery. Really weird since the items I ordered after that were successful and I'm anxious to use credit card anymore until I get the refund. This is my first time to ask for a refund and contacted 3 agents for a month since it was returned as failed deliver. I was told it takes 15-30days to process it and yep, it is more than a month now. Not happy so contacted again, and voila ""We will make sure to process your refund po"" and end chat. Di pa rin na resolve. The customer support were unreliable and not helpful pushing their policy over customer satisfaction. There IS TOTALLY NO SUPPORT in the word ""CUSTOMER SUPPORT"". Didnt know until this time that it's a pain in the ass dealing with these people when in the first place not your fault. Feels like their process is a total dumbass-they do not own up to their own fault. I will wait up in the next 7 business days to see if they will ""good lord"" process my refund.

After 3 days of contacting the customer service, I was told it takes 15-30days to process it. And another 24hours to get it credited back to my account. The service reps were uncompromising pushing their policy over customer satisfaction. Didnt know it was hell dealing with returns with these guys. feels like their process is discouraging you to return the items. If the company makes it difficult for you to return the item, it tells you what kind of company values they have (if they have at all) and the kind of people pushing such values.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Being a diligent person,"Being a diligent person, I wanted to let Philippine Airlines know that I would not be making my flight (2 weeks in advance).  I already knew that they would not give me a refund but I expected a might get a partial value for future use.  I was wrong tho.  According to the phone agent, I would not get any partial value but ON TOP OF THIS, I HAD TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL $300 JUST TO CANCEL THE FLIGHT!!.  That seems ludicrous to me, and very short sited by the airline as this seat would become available again if cancelled and they could sell it again.  Anyway, if you fly PAL make sure you will never have to change or cancel it.Update:By messaging Philippine Airlines Facebook Messenger, they were able to tell me that what the agent told me was not right, and I would not be charged anything to cancel the ticket.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,WORST AIRLINE EVER FLOWN,"Below I'll post the formal complaint email I sent over a month ago (still with no response).I am in utter disbelief at my poor experience with Philippine Airlines. There have been so many issues I'm at a loss as to where to start.Perhaps first I should elaborate on some feedback / formal complaint I submitted through your website. I instantly received a confirmation email that the feedback had been received and that I'd be contacted within '48 - 72' hours. The said issues were reported on 31 July 2018 and to date I still haven't had a correct response. In fact, Several follow up emails were sent on 31 July 2018 (again), 4 August 2018 and 8 August 2018 (X 3 emails on this date). In addition, a high number of contacts were made through your Facebook page in the hope of some form of assistance. In fact, I'd ask you personally review the entire Facebook trail between myself and Philippine Airlines to really gain an understanding of quite how unhelpful the airline has been.After reading all website and email correspondence, plus the Facebook Messenger trail, please kindly provide a full explanation for the following:1. Why Philippine Airlines claim not to have received my initial contact through the website, despite the confirmation email I instantly received.2. Why the promise of '48 - 72' hours to respond has clearly been blown out of the water and even today I'm still awaiting answers.3. Why the staff responsible for your Facebook medium as a contact method are either completely lacking empowerment or are totally incompetent. I would have made more progress relaying the issues to a brick wall.It is imperative the initial contact, made through the website, is urgently located and answered in full. In addition the subsequent emails also need to be considered, investigated and answered in full.At this stage I will add I (finally) did hear from the 'Customer Care Manager' Ms XYZ, via email, after many attempts at requesting her contact. She managed to completely ignore all the points I made, bar one, in which I had reported damage to an expensive item of Ralph Lauren clothing. Rather than addressing my concern, she simply dismissed the communication saying my feedback has been forwarded to the respective offices. No apology. No explanation. No investigation. No offer of reimbursement or compensation. Unbelievable.This brings me to the next part of my complaint. Prior to continuing, I would like to make a couple of points. I regularly fly around the world (including the recent journey I've made with Philippine Airlines) and have done for over 25 years. I've flown the entire spectrum of airlines from the cheapest (generally the Chinese airlines, AirAsia etc) to in my opinion the best (Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand etc). I'm an easy going traveller and generally very relaxed. It's rare I ever make a complaint to any company, let alone an airline. However, I feel so strongly about the poor service experienced it's essential I follow this up in writing. It is essential, as mentioned, my original website contact is located and investigated as a number of significant points were made in which my dissatisfaction is explained.Upon arriving at the airport to take my Melbourne to Manila flight I was greeted by a queue with over 100 people waiting (see attached). There were a total of 3 staff checking in customers and none which seemed bothered by the single hour left until the plane was due to depart. Chatting amongst ourselves, it appeared the 5 groups ahead of me in the queue had also fallen victim to Philippine Airline's unusable website - hence had to manually check in. The 6 hours it took trying to book the flights, which eventually resulted in having to book over the telephone, in addition to the 4.5 hours I spent attempting to check in, meant I could relate. In fact, the staff taking my checked in bag for my Manila to Melboune flight even commented that every passenger mentions the website and the issues they face. Surely a reason to fix it?The Wi-Fi provided on-board appears a joke at best. I had a need to use several hours worth of access for business - however - upon trialling the service on my Melbourne to Manila flight it was clear the service was inadequate for use. Please access the log records to see the number of connection and disconnection attempts I faced, rendering the service completely useless.I'm currently writing this formal complaint upon my Manila to London flight. I'm so angry and utterly disgusted it felt necessary to document this part of the experience whilst fresh and current in my mind. For this flight I was greeted by rubbish in the seat pocket in front of me - old tissues, used cutlery and half an apple. Delightful. The USB socket is not working (which your Head Staff Member on-board, Mr X, advised it's up to the passengers to report issues as they are not checked or ever tested otherwise. Amazing). I mentioned to Gerado nobody had bothered to replenish the hand soap in one of the toilets in front of me on the left - despite mentioning this, nothing was done.The on-board service has been nothing short of extremely disappointing. I (politely) asked if a second meal would be possible. I'm fully aware this is at the goodwill of an airline and not an entitlement (nor such a necessity if they were a normal airline sized meal). I was told on 4 occasions someone would check. On each occasion nobody came to let me know. 1.5 hours after the initial meal, I was bought a second (chicken and not the beef I had asked for - perhaps the beef had run out - not an issue - it just would have been nice to have been told). By this stage the chicken was cold, so I left it. Perhaps I'd have more luck with a beer, I thought. Upon asking for the Belgium style beer, 5 times, I was bought a Heineken. Without apology or explanation. I (politely) asked for a Belgium beer to which I was told they had run out. It wasn't until I spoke with Mr X did magic start to happen - there was instant concern about my USB port, the beer I was told had run out strangely appeared and there almost appeared to be a care factor in the air. It may have been a coincidence though my thoughts would be by asking Mr X to write down his name, a little panic was sparked. One of the cabin crew even appeared with a notepad and paper asking me to write down my email address. After my (lack of) contact experience to date, I politely declined. Being reactive rather than proactive unfortunately meant it was too late to try and fix the pieces.Furthermore, on this same flight, when it was 18:20 at the place of origin, according to the in-flight system, the cabin lights flicked on and off for a period of 20 minutes. This instantly woke up most of the sleeping passengers in this area of the plane, which had already been darkened. I'm sure the staff on-board can confirm this fault. No apology nor explanation, as always.Furthermore, the toilet containing the lack of hand soap is clearly faulty as it would swing open on many occasions, including those when passengers were trying to sleep. Containing a bright interior light, again passengers were instantly woken. Many around me commented on their dissatisfaction regarding this. If Philippine Airlines had a proper complaint system in place, you could expect to receive complaints regarding this.Furthermore again, the seat on this flight had a faulty button for the reclining option. Upon pushing it the seat would recline however after releasing the button, it would not release correctly, and the seat would resume the up right position.As mentioned a number of times, I am requesting a full explanation for all points mentioned above, in my initial contact, the subsequent emails, and without the response coming from Ms X. I'm requesting the response is by return email only.Further to this, I am requesting a full refund on the entire trip including taxes. At the very least, I will accept an equivalent complimentary trip which I'm sure you'll consider fair given this has been the worst airline experience I've had to date.I look forward to prompt confirmation of receipt of this email.Sincerely",1,4-Sep-18,6,GB,NULL,Sep,9,2018

Today I spoke with them again, since I saw no update in the tracking system. I was told that particular warehouse is ""having a problem"".

They are currently receiving a lot of callers! Crap!Went to one of their stores to raise my concern on Feb 2nd. Initially, the agent from that store asked me to connect to 211 to raise my concern. Luckily, i was able to talk to a CS agent online! Asked BS questions... Told me that the reason why I got disconnected? That my account has been considered for migration..when? 2/13?? And i said like, i didnt receive any notifications beforehand. And how will i be disconnected so early?? In the end she requested the agent from that store to create JO. Darn! Thanks to that store agent who patiently assisted me. JO has been submitted. Got an SMS confirmation that my concern will be attended not later than Feb 5th and that I will receive SMS notifying that my JO is being processed. The day came... No call... No text from them... So.. I needed again to call 211 crap.. I asked the status of the JO... Nothing was logged! Darn! She ended up creating another JO..submitted to whichever department it is (the hell!)...

She agreed to process the refund ASAP. Now waiting on how fast they can refund. I gave them a second chance but obviously they never changed.

Lazada,1.5,Bad,Lets See if This Gets Any Results,"Dear Lazada,I’m writing to you in a last ditch, last resort, effort to get a festering problem resolved. I’ve written to you; I’ve called you; I’ve talked to your incompetent assistant named Cleo; and I’ve written to your fulfillment partner, R&X Power Tools, all to no avail. This is my final effort to avoid the inevitable: Deleting your web page from my computers and phones and ceasing to do any further business with Lazada. At this point you might want to take a look at how much business I’ve done with Lazada over the years in order to have a better grasp as to the size of this problem.Last September I placed order number 245850362489532 for a Makita welding machine part #MMA-400. Your fulfillment partner was R&X Power Tools. The machine had a 6-month warranty. Unfortunately, I didn’t try-out the machine until after the warranty had expired. (Okay, that’s my fault.) When our contractor tried to use the machine to fix our gate, we found that the machine didn’t work at all. I wrote to R&X Tool (no phone number was provided) and explained the problem. I asked to return the machine (I’ll pay the freight); asked that R&X get it fixed (I’ll pay for having it fixed); and asked that the machine be returned to me (I’ll pay the return freight). I also asked R&X tool to call me (+63-0917-301-0441) so we could discuss the situation and I could get their address. All R&X did was send me 12 copies of their return goods form that was so blurry I could hardly read it. I finally sorted it out to the point that I clicked “all my orders; found the R&X Tool order; but the promised “RETURN BUTTON” wasn’t there. I tried to leave a “REVIEW”, but that button had been disabled. Again, I asked R&X Tools to call me but to no avail. I have screen shots of all my communications with R&X Tool if you want to see them.At this point I’m at the end of my rope. I have done everything I can think of in an effort to find a fair resolution to this situation. I have also taken the machine to three local companies to see if they could fix it but they either couldn’t or wouldn’t repair the unit. And, unfortunately, R&X Tool remains mute and refuses to discuss the matter.  I’m now asking you, Lazada, to intervene on my behalf with your provider, R&X Tool, in an effort to find a fair and equitable solution to my problem. Right now, I’m out P6000. on a worthless machine. I would also like to get from you R&X Tool’s contact information (phone, address, etc.). And, if you could turn on their “Review” button it would be most appreciated.SincerelyJim CusterTalisay CityNegros Occidental",1,27-Jul-20,1,PH,NULL,Jul,7,2020

It's only this year with the start of covid that this happened to me. Had a series of failed deliveries, some COD and others already paid. If COD, kawawa ang supplier. If already paid, kawawa costumer. Either way, May kawawa dahil sa Lazada. I think most if not, some of the failed deliveries is because of pilferage. I guess because of the hard times staff from the sorting station steal these items, specially the paid ones. I will never order from lazada again. Costumer service? They can't help you. Actually it's not a costumer service. It's just there for lazada to look like a legit company but in reality costumer service can't do anything but look into your account and say sorry.

But this store don't care about you and they will just deliver the flower in their own accord.This Company is so discriminating!!! I have prepared earlier so they won't mess up our anniversary, and yet, here they are, messed everything up!!!I was so disappointed that my wife has received the flower ahead of schedule. Now, I have to find another flower store who are not discriminating and would not mess up everything that I've worked for.This is a piece of advise for everyone.

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,Same experience as many…,"Echoing the same experience as many recent reviewers: the company reflected and ‘faked’ delivery status as ‘attempted delivery’ when none were made. Right now, I’m still waiting for the 3rd rescheduled delivery. Clearly, writing in to their customer service doesn’t and can’t do anything (claimed their delivery personnel chose the wrong status and will escalate the issue), and the company is not upfront about their current situation and/or rectifying these issues to the wider population on the receiving end of their services. To make things worse, the popular marketplaces in our region uses Ninjavan.TBH, a delay is understandable given the tremendous uptick in ecomm business since COVID. But for the company to inform end-consumers: (1) delivery will be made on certain date(s) to only have it not delivered and (2) falsely indicating in their system that delivery attempt was made and/or customer requested to reschedule delivery (when it wasn’t the case), is almost dishonest to put in simple terms.The service wasn’t always this bad and had been satisfactory in the past.

Entrego,1.4,Bad,Absolutely abhorrent service.,"Every single time this abortion of a courier service has been forced onto me by Shopee, there has always been a problem. Shopee's other couriers like J&T Express and NinjaVan have been excellent all throughout quarantine, but Entrego is a different beast altogether. It took more than a month for packages to arrive in Cebu, and many packages I've had them handle have been canceled due to the sheer incompetence and unprofessionalism of their riders. Some don't even attempt to deliver the package and mark it as failed delivery. Others are extremely rude. If the only positive thing I have to say about your courier is ""some packages have been delivered to me,"" then there is something very wrong with you. Today, I have been waiting for a package that has been marked as ""out for delivery"" for two straight days now, and I've decided all I can do is at least send a warning to everyone who gets Entrego. Their customer service is basically nonexistent. I really hope Shopee cuts ties with Entrego, all their other couriers have given me good to great service all throughout quarantine days. What's Entrego's excuse? Simply too lazy? Too incompetent? Might as well close down and call it a day, because their mere existence is an inconvenience to everyone purchasing packages. Pray you don't get Entrego when ordering a package overseas. If you do, may God be with you.",1,17-Sep-20,1,PH,NULL,Sep,9,2020

I also travelled with them 2-3 years ago, and my experience was excellent at that time too, however I forgot to write a review at that time. Finally their seat comfort and quality is spectacular, and very spacious.

I tapped the app. Very bad internet! I cant play! Few years later the WiFi got much better! Then I played Roblox. It wasnt fun because the WiFi was soo bad I could not play the good games in Roblox. So I played bad games in roblox. Then my mom allowed me to play Roblox on her MacBook so I did. It was a bit laggy tho. Then 1 year later my mom allowed me to play fortnite. Yes I did play Fortnite on a pc one day and no lag. But thats because I was in a restaurant filled with gaming computers. But Fortnite mobile in my house? Disgusting! Frame rates are very high and lags a lot. So much lag that in Nov 2019, I smashed my iPad. So then my parents bought another iPad. I hit it one time (probably because of lag or I got sniped). Then I never hit it again. Then I played Jurassic world the game all over again. Serious lag and always disconnects at some point while I play. Then I saw Jurassic World Alive. I stopped playing JWTG and played JWA. It didnt lag too much but by the day I was writing this, it was very laggy. My Fortnite was very laggy too while I was practicing with my edits.

Singlife Philippines,4.6,Excellent,Filed a claim for both Dengue Test and Fever,"Filed a claim for both Dengue Test and Dengue Fever on Dec. 3, 2021 and got the cash benefit on Dec. 28, 2021. Submitting the documents was easy and confirmation email was fast. The problem was with the waiting time. If I had not sent an email to the team regarding my claim, it would have probably taken longer. Maybe Singlife could add a tracker for the claims?

Big flaw is they will let you set up an account without telling you upfront you will not be able to order without a local phone number (at least that has been what I was told), meaning upon my arrival to Thailand, I was able to set up an account but not until trying to order to found out that I could not order.  Now I have a local number, and I can not log into my account to add the number. There live chat for customer is based you being logged in, so I can not use that option! E-mailing them is less than useless, mostly you get automated e-mail responses telling to go to the Customer Service page on their website which does you no good. If you use them for purchases, then I would make sure your credit card provider will stand by you if needed.I am told there are some good deals at Lazada but if you are in Thailand best you know the many other option to buy from since Lazada may just make it more difficult for you.",1,12-Jul-21,4,TH,NULL,Jul,7,2021

Shopee,1.8,Poor,Shopee Shockee!,"For the first time, I decided to try Shopee in order to purchase an external hard-drive.

Here's the catch... I can get a refund into my bank (I don't have banking facilities in Philippines) or I can activate ""Shopee Pay"" through their App. I don't use the App, I use the website through my laptop. Nevertheless, I downloaded the App and sent verification details (with a picture of my passport, etc.) which failed.I've had enough... this item was ordered two months ago, it's taken eight weeks for me to donate PHP 1,679 to Shopee - if I was going to make a charitable donation, it would have been to a worthy cause and not an arrogant and complacent company whose staff seem incapable of understanding that customers are customers. If I hadn't paid for the item, I could understand but I did... I paid cash.I would advise anyone thinking of using Shopee to think VERY carefully about their decision; my own experiences have been truly shocking.

You are delivering to a school address and you also need to understand that students return home for the weekend. Can you please factor this in your scheduling algorithm as well so that drivers can prioritise if not at least stick to their promised delivery date? Driver called me on a Saturday expecting me to be in school to receive my parcel, not only was he rude in his replies when I asked if he could leave it in the mailbox (because it was a small item), he hung up on me before I could ask whats the alternative delivery date. I hope there can be a review system for drivers as well so that they know we are also agitated by the fact that they took so long to deliver our parcels. Please sort this issue out Ninja van, you used to be the top delivery service in Singapore but I don't think you can claim this title anymore.",1,25-Sep-21,1,SG,NULL,Sep,9,2021

Shopee,1.8,Poor,Fire Half of Your Customer Service Reps and Improve Your Review System,"Got an item that doesn't work. Tried to return using Shopee's return system, and the system cannot provide a shipper for me to use to return said item. Had to use the chat system with their CSRs. Out of 4 chats, I had two pleasant ones. The other two were aggravating experiences. One customer aggravation rep (CAR) kept told me to ship the item without a bar code printed, and then told me to fix my smartphone, even though I told her I had the same problem even when I was using a web browser on my laptop. And then told me I can't login to two devices at a time, which isn't true. She got frustrated and dropped the chat. The other CAR was so smug she ended the chat when I commented that I wish this wouldn't be another aggravating experience. Glad the last CSR was very helpful and allowed me to air my frustration with the CARs and managed to escalate my problem to a team. Shopee's system stands to improve a lot. I already mentioned its system cannot get me to return an item in-app, which would be convenient and which they wanted to do but couldn't manage to. So I ended up having to use another shipper with an app to print a bar code for shipping. But I would find out that some shipping apps cannot accept the return address of Shopee: it has the longest address in the world:Shopee WarehouseBlock 2, Lots 2,3,10 & 11, Honest St. co. Determined St., Calamba Premiere International Park (CPIP), Batino, Calamba City, South Luzon, Laguna Philippines 4027It all came down to Shopee telling me ship via J&T, and by then there's only one day left before the return window expires. Asked to extend it, they refused because they can't be bothered to make an exception, because of ""policy.""Terrible. Terrible customer service reps - very rude. And very unaccommodating system design - where it makes it very hard to make very very simple returns.The bad thing also is that I cannot make a review of the lousy product- A Youngrow wrist blood pressure monitor. Since I returned a lousy item, and that kept me from giving a terrible scathing review of the item in question. It needs to be said - Shopee's system of review is downright useless. You can't really make a review on a product. You can make a review on packaging, shipping speed and responsiveness to queries. But really, you are buying a product and you can't have a long term, much less medium term - update on your experience using a product. This makes it hard for sellers to offer products that have good quality but cost a premium. So you end up with sellers selling el cheapo products because the review system encourages them to do so. In effect, Shopee (as well as Lazada) sell cheap products that in the long run cost more to the consumer. Shopee can emulate Amazon, which has a great review system, but it chooses not to. It says a lot about where they stand on product quality and offering such products to the consumer.And Shopee isn't very customer-centric. It doesn't allow the consumer to save a transcript of chat sessions wth its CSRs. It does this by design. Because it knows half of its CSRs are rude, and it is afraid it's not going away because they do not vet their CSRs well enough. And there's no excuse for it. Philippines provide CSRs to the world, and with large companies such as Amazon, the CSRs have been very courteous all the time. Never a bad experience. So why is it that half of the CSRs of Shopee are rude and mislead clients with inane and wrong answers?",3,31-Jan-21,3,PH,NULL,Jan,1,2021

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Hi I am a Filipina based in Dubai,"Hi I am a Filipina based in Dubai. I book a ticket online direct to the Philippineairline.com, after confirming my book I checked every detail of my bookings, then confirmed all is okay from the form I submitted and the ticket I printed.1. Now, Aug 25 2019. here comes the flight, the teller in Dubai area was telling that the name in the ticket is different to the system. How come? And the amount of luggage in the ticket is higher compared to the one in the system wherein the name was changed and the weight of the allowable luggage was less with 2 kg each, means, if in you correct written name in ticket is 25kg each in the system where in they changed the name was already changed into 23kg each boxes.2. I called PhilAir customer service I spoke with a call center agent name Lorie, yes they are just a call center they said they cant do anything about it. when she read the complete name of the person I book, she was reading some slash thing. Madam SIr Philippine Airlines, I did not put any Slash when I booked. she told me that the only thing we could do is to follow what the teller told us to do. so we have to remove 2kg each from 2 boxes, poor kabayan. So nothing I could do, done fixing luggage again and went back to the counter. here comes the teller, to angry to the poor Filipina, telling her why did she complain, why did she call, in a span of minute that teller already knows what happened.. Is this a bad strategy of FILIPINO businesses? ""do you want me to let you go back again. no matter what you do even you will complain you cannot do anything"" she is so much shouting in the counter. Luckily we are not able to get her name because she left the post after wards. But GOD have eyes, you have a Family to Madam Lorie and the teller in the Philippine airlines. GOD hears what you said. KARMA is there. if you love your family and you are working for your family ""DO GOOD DEEDS"" KARMA will come to you in whatever you do.Thank you so much for your good service PHILIPPINE AIRLINES.

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,Ninja van Ninjavan consistently failed,"Hi, dear all,I am trying to stay objective and factual by seeking any similar incidents.For the past 2 years, I have been a heavy and regular user (client, patron and fan) of Superbuy and IE-Post.Sellers in China via Taobao, Tmall, Xianyu (Idle Fish), Weidian, etc -> Superbuy -> Shipper (IE-post) using (Shipping methods: IE and IE-MG) -> When parcels reach local shores -> IE-Post hand over packages local courier, example recently Ninja VanIn recent months, I personally experienced that ever since IE Post switched to Ninja Van,I have experienced more than once failures in terms of:- safety of my parcels (parcels have been damaged resulting in damages to the contents). I have ascertained it is not Superbuy's or IE-Post's fault from reviewing the videos of packing, value-add services, packer ID tags, internal controls, etc- reliability (consistently, parcels are delayed with parcels submitted earlier being delayed while parcels submitted later have arrived)- scheduling (I discovered Ninja Van's business model and sales pitch to forwarders like IE Post are based on their much touted computer algorithim optimised to cut costs and minimise time for Ninja Van, while allowing and condoning compromised schedulking; and customer service)- customer service (or lack of). Emails to Ninja Van are glossed over by Ninja van's customer support; who either throw the problem back to the customer (asking you to go contact the forwarder yourself to solve yuourself) or pass the buck (putting the blame on IE Post or even Superbuy). Worst, deflecting, dismissing and ignoring your emails entirely. Their customer service is a joke- a lip service and exist for the sake of having a so-called customer service!I attached screencaptures of the recent (repeatedly so) damaged parcel (and dismal customer service: at best, unprofessional; at worst, unprofessional and unbecoming in the capacity as customer service representing the company Ninja Van).Hi, I agree... Repeatedly consistently I faced difficulties with the homegrown ninja van in failing to meet in terms of quality/reliability/safe handling for deliveries, flexibility in scheduling and any form of assurance in terms of customer service/support! Ninjavan has damaged my parcels more than once, causing damages to the contents. For example, please see screencaptures below. For damage, despite m supplying all the photos and details, they kept emailing to ask for more explanation! Then comes the claim. They admitted liability yet they push it to the forwarder and purchasing agent! Despite admitting the liability, i received conflicting messages and discovered they actually wanted the forwarder and purchasing agent to pay. AND this happened more than once! WORSE, the customer service is dismal. For example, in my latest recent parcel which is damaged, customer service simply deflected the problem, threw the problem back to the customer and even passed the buck to the customer to go solve himself. And she is so inconsistent and contradictory in her replies. And in my last email to her to clarify, she simply refused to reply though my receipts showed she read it, instead she rudely forward me an email of the forwarder without any explanation! This is NOT the first time. WORST, if you email or submit enquiry tickets, they will never be elevated upwards. The customer service will intercept at their level- to the extent of simply ignoring you! And my attempts to contact the senior management, (despite all the talk on their website about feedback) example CEO or COO (or even the company Facebook) fell on deaf ears!!! Email receipts showed they received, and read- yet not even a short note from them!!! Then I found out their business model is to offer cost-cutting and time-saving to their partners (WITHOUT considering us, the end users who are the final recipients) from their much touted (and I experienced) so-called computer algorithm in ""optimising"" routing and timing! And of course, their customer service is actually more like a dis-service or mere lip service- the end user comes to them with a problem, but the customer service will throw the problem back to the customer and ask the customer to go contact the forwarder or their business partners). And this is NOT the first or second time! Are we stuck with Ninja Van if we choose to use IE-Post?For screencaptures as evidences, please refer to my sharing on reddit. Here it seems I cannot upload images.",1,14-Oct-19,7,SG,NULL,Oct,10,2019

In fact, it opened up another opportunity for another income stream, it is just a matter of putting it into action all the learnings we've gathered and eventually earn from trading by our own. In addition, the 3 coaching sessions which is included in the package with the great LTT coaches will really help us a lot in this journey of trading.  To conclude, the LTT Phils. family will not allow their students like me leaving the training with an empty handed, coaches sees to it that all their knowledge and skills in trading are imparted to us in their best way possible before they will leave us into the wild and start trading by our own.

That is when all the nightmare started.I have done my due deligent to make sure the seller has a rating of 90% or above before I place any online order with them. Unfortunately for this case, the seller was uncontactable for 15days with my purchase status pending processing. During this 15 days, the estimated deivery date was actually been rescheduled once. After which the seller contacted me that they had to cancel my order as they do not have enough stocks. So I thought all is good right? Since I made my purchase with the good and reliable Lazada, I will be able to get my refund to make another Gopro 7 purchase right? I am so wrong. I had to contact them everyday to get a reply on the refund statues. After which they told me that Lazada will only refund the amount less the $60 voucher which I had applied. Which mean that the $60 voucher I have earned by spending $600 with Lazada is gone just because the seller is unable to fulfil my purchase. So I send in an appeal.Keep it in mind that the $60 was a LAZADA 11.11 PROMO. After 2 weeks of constence checking with Lazada, the customer service staff finally got a reply from their managment saying that they are unable to reinstate my $60 voucher as the ""code"" was issued by the seller. And that I can take advantage of their oncoming promo by visiting the ""link.""Please check the facts right before replying.Firstly, it was a LAZADA 11.11 PROMO Voucher. I've made multiple purchase with different seller in order to achieve $600 spending on LAZADA. Which means I had earn the ""Spend $600 to get $60 voucher"" from LAZADA's PROMO and not from any other seller.Secondly, with this type of customer service do you think I would dare to take the risk of losing my vouchers after spending a fortune with Lazada?Thirdly, I find it pretty dumb to not be able to leave any review or ratings on the seller whom was not able to process my purchase. This type of seller will greatly affect our customer's shopping expirience with LAZADA.I do not think it is right to let your loyal customer bear the $60 loss just because your seller was unable to meet on the demand. Specially after 15 days of delay in the processing status and 2 weeks of contence chasing refunds with Lazada customer service. This purchase is a TOTAL NIGHTMARE.

An arrogant manager named ""Ron"" who I wonder where he learned his basics of customer service came from spoke to me on the phone, no help provided. Next day, after making me wait for 13 days, ORDER WAS CANCELLED. Reason being as per rep: The package that was received by the sortation team was poor. THE HELL!!!!!!! You make consumers wait for an order which is supposed to be a priority then after almost two weeks, you cancel the order from your end?! If the received package was poor, why was it not replaced by an unacceptable one? Is the package very limited that only one was produced in the world that no replacement can be sought out?

I sent an email with all the attachments to the email address they gave me.  Months later, they said that do not have the proper paperwork that I sent THREE times!  So then was told I sent it to the wrong department.  I asked, ""does the person at the department really need to be told to forward the email to the correct department?""  Is that really that difficult?  I've been switched from one department to the next and after 22 minutes on hold was told I was transferred to the wrong department so he transferred me and he recording said ""you wait time is 15 minutes!""  I hung up and cried because I have been doing in circles with them for 4 months now.  I spend over an hour every time I have to call.  At this point, I do not want to start a new contract with PLDT, but there are no other companies here (my Globe experience was exactly the same).  It feels so hopeless.  So sad.  I have completely given up on Fibr because I would be locked into another 24 month contract with such an inefficient company.  It's not the service reps on the phone--they are always friendly.

Lazada,1.5,Bad,This should be zero.,"How could a service get even more disappointing after giving it a second chance, well my fault. Their chat service is really useless, they say the same thing over and over which they never do anyway. Chatted with them about my order that never arrived and agents don't have any idea what happened to my order considering it was the fourth time I asked them to check my order. The only solution I got was ""escalate to the right department"", yes, that's all I got after chatting with them many times and after I waited for my order for more than a month. My first order 200221426689998 took almost a month of follow up until I got so tired of waiting I just had to cancel it. Gave them another chance, maybe the next would be better. So I ordered 201472065889998. Well, it's the same. It took over a month of follow up and every time agents don't seem to have any idea what happened to my order. I still had the patience to wait. Then I asked them if my refund for my first order has already been processed, well the agent seemed to sympathize and said that it's the same like my second order, it hasn't moved anywhere, nothing happened. But wait there's more, I received an e-mail from them stating that my refund for my second order has been processed. What? I was expecting a refund for my first order. I haven't even cancelled my second order. And so I had to check my order status online and they did cancel it with the reason ""item lost"". Okay, that's the last straw, I used to enjoy Lazada's service but it's time to look for a better online shopping experience.

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,THIS STORE WILL MESS UP YOUR DAY.,"I AM A DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER OF THIS ONLINE SHOP.I ordered a Sunset Love bouquet 10 days before Valentine's as a surprise gift to my loved one. Here's my experience from ordering online up to receiving the item.I ordered online using a mobile phone. At first, I was hesitant to proceed to the payment method page because I am unable to see an option where you can select a delivery date. So I sent them a PM via FB messenger and the representative told me that there's a calendar upon checkout. However, when I submitted my order and paid using a debit card, there was no calendar where I can choose a date. Then their rules for same day delivery got in my mind because I ordered before 5PM on Monday and the website states that if you order before 5PM, same day delivery will apply. Since I was afraid that my order will be delivered the next day, I sent them an email to request for the item to be delivered on 14 Feb. I received a reply from Abby Aquino and advised that they can deliver the order on 14 Feb and asked me for a timeslot. Then I selected the 7am-10am slot. Abby has advised that they cannot promise a specific delivery time due to their order line up- which I accepted.8 days before 14 Feb 2019, I requested for a change in delivery address via FB messenger due to an unexpected situation. Then my request was granted and the representative told me ""noted on the new address"". 11 Feb 2019, I sent another PM in FB to request for a minimal change in address and to add a note on the card that comes along with the bouquet which the representative has acknowledged by replying ""noted on these po"".12 Feb 2019, I requested for another address update due to a change of plan with my company. I sent my message via FB and email. I received a reply in email advising that their last day of accepting changes or special requests was on 10 Feb. By this time, I wondered why the representative in FB acknowledged my change of address on 11 Feb when their cut off was on 10 Feb. So I replied and requested to update the address for the last time. An agent named BRIAN SANTOS replied on 13 Feb saying that the change has been noted. I was relieved and grateful at first but then, the worst nightmare came.14 Feb 2019- VALENTINE'S DAYI received a call from our security personnel in the previous address that I have requested to be changed on 12 Feb advising that the order was delivered there. I was shocked and extremely disappointed because the new address was not applied even if the agent has acknowledged it. The hassle of getting the order from the old address to the new address has extremely F*CKED MY DAY UP because I have had to arrange a transport service in order for the item to be given to my loved one on Valentine's day. Also, when I was confirming the details via email and FB prior to the day and on the day of delivery, I haven't received a reply from both channels. I understand that I have a fault on this one too due to multiple change of address requests. But I think the representatives should have kept their promise when they say ""noted"".Also, the flowers arrived past 10 am which has gone beyond the timeslot I have selected- 7am to 10am. What is the purpose for.selecting a time slot if the order will still be delivered late?  Flowers appear not to be fresh because some of the petals have withered. The message card was blank even if I have requested for a message to be written on it.I will not recommend this online shop. IT HAS CAUSED ME A LOT OF HASSLES AND MESSED UP MY VALENTINE'S. TRAIN YOUR REPRESENTATIVES WELL AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY WORD THAT THEY ARE GIVING TO THE CUSTOMERS ARE BEING KEPT AS I DO NOT WANT THE OTHER FIRST TIMERS TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME.Thank you for messing up my Valentine's Day.",1,"Updated Mar 16, 2019",1,PH,Updated,Mar,3,2019

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,All good,"I always order from island rose for my mom’s annual celebrations (birthday, mother’s day, etc). Then, i stumbled upon this site on the internet with really beautiful flower arrangements at reasonable prices. Without hesitation, i did book online since im from Dubai, weeks before my mom’s bday. The transaction was smooth and flawless. They reply back as soon as they can to answer any queries from customers. However, why 4 and not 5? The flowers i received was far from the picture i saw online. It looked like a bunch of flowers stuck carelessly inside the box. I was really disappointed and contacted them immediately after my mom received the flowers. They apologized for it and offered a 50% discount. I didn’t give in to that offer coz i wanted the best for my mom. I also wanted my money’s worth. After too much complaining and whining, they finally said to replace the flowers with a new one and they wanted the old one back. I agreed to that and waited for their action. Hours after that same day, they were able to deliver another box of flowers same as the one in the picture. I was really happy coz my mom was also happy. And, they even said to take the old one as well. I was about to give 5 but the whining and all made me really feel bad. Im from another country and i had to contact them for hours just to fix the problem. But overall, im happy coz my mom is satisfied.",4,22-Mar-19,1,IN,NULL,Mar,3,2019

Globe Telecom,1.1,Bad,All Good While Grabbing Your Money,"I am a British expat who lived in the Philippines for eight years. In 2018 I left the country just a few months after opening a new account for Globe Home Broadband.As the account was subject to a two-year tie-in, and being a good, honest customer, I continued with my payment obligations for the remainder of that contractual period, even though that meant that for 18 months, I was paying for a service that was no longer of any use to me.The tie-in recently expired, and now, as I expected (having plenty of experience of trying to disconnect accounts with Globe and PLDT during my eight years in the Philippines) Globe is, of course, making it extremely difficult for me to arrange disconnection. For a so-called communications company, their communication capabilities are appalling. No agents to answer any phone calls (just automation), no email address through which customers can contact them, and no simple online chat facility to use via their apps.No, if you want to talk to Globe, you have to have a Facebook or Twitter account. Thank you, but I'm not into social media, and I don't want to join Facebook just to talk to my telecoms provider. Therefore, I have had to communicate with them using my wife's Facebook messenger. Via that channel, I have to go round in circles, answering the same questions over and over, like: ""What is your email address"" (they send their bills to it so they already have it), ""What is the installation address?"" (It's the one on the bills they send, so they already have it), ""Would you like to downgrade your account?"" (No, I don't live in the Philippines, so Globe is no longer of any use to me).How ridiculous!... And then they tell me that they must be able to access the property where the modem is installed, to retrieve it. Having disconnected with both Globe and PLDT previously, I know for a fact that their technicians never visit terminating customers to uninstall their equipment. Good luck with that as I've been out of the country for nearly two years, and I only rented my home there.Oh!... and then they keep telling me, via my wife's Facebook, that I can arrange disconnection more easily through the Globe One or Globe at Home app. That's funny, because the only possible option offered by the app, is to... Yes, you guessed it...  chat with Gie (or whatever the fake name is) via Facebook messenger.The saga continues, confirming what I already know... That Globe's communication capabilities are at a level surpassed by most businesses back in the 1990s. That's hilarious given the sector in which they ""operate"".Of course, it's all with good reason. After all, as they are granted a virtual monopoly in the Philippines, with little if no competition allowed, they don't want to offer customers straightforward options to do anything that doesn't involve paying overinflated prices for an internet service that would have been reasonable, at best, at the turn of the century.Yes, go with Globe if you want easy ways to part with your money, but god forbid that you should want any semblance of customer assistance, or especially to dare to create the cardinal sin of becoming an ex-customer. Even moving thousands of miles away to a different hemisphere would appear not to be a fair reason to expect a simple process to close an account. My only regret is that I didn't just stop paying my monthly bills as soon as I left the country, in spite of the two-year contractual tie-in. It would have been easy, but I believe in honoring my commitments. Unfortunately, Globe is in the enviable position of being free to disregard theirs, and to be the communications company that can't communicate.Would I recommend them to consumers as a service provider? If you want the answer, read the above once more.",1,11-Feb-21,2,CY,NULL,Feb,2,2021

What the seller actually shipped to me was a 'Micromatic' branded model and when I complained they lied to me that both brands are exactly the same model and it, Micromatic, is the only model that they stocked, when I subsequently checked the then American Legacy brand listings they were all fraudulent, thay were actually for a Micromatic brand.So getting on to Lazada and going thru all the questions and answers, pictures etc. they asked that I return the item, I live on an island where we only have one branch of LBC and the tricycle fare to/from is PHP500 so we don't want to be wasting journeys to and from.I agreed to return it so asked Lazada for a 'Micromatic' returns label which they couldn't provide because I had never ordered a Micromatic, I had only ordered an American Legacy, I explained that LBC will not accept such a fraudulent discrepancy but rather than act to avoid such a situation they encouraged me to commit fraud by taking it to a different branch of LBC, we only have one branch!Lazada simply cannot provide a returns label for an item that wasn't ordered.",1,24-Dec-20,3,PH,NULL,Dec,12,2020

I agreed to the purple tulips, however the flowers were not delivered. I sent them a message on messenger on 17 February to ask for the status, and their resolution was for me to order again because even the purple tulips were out of stock. I explained to them that I will not order again seeing that I still have a pending order that was not delivered and I was requesting for it to be replaced by something else. It was not resolved via messenger, so I made an overseas call to them. I spoke to a gentleman who was kind enough to provide me with options and promised delivery on the 18th for February (next day). I ended up ordering sunflowers and will receive a refund because tulips were more expensive than the sunflowers. Up until today my friend never received the flowers and the 40 day memorial was on the 16th.

It seems they have high volume nearly 100% of the year. If they have high volume nothing prevents them from scaling up.

This is my 2nd time to order in this shop and it really gives Happiness to the receiver 💖 1st order in this shop is my husband's birthday & he was really surprised bcoz I'm in Quarantine and this flower delivery made his birthday special though we can't be together. 2nd time is my grandparents anniversary. My lola was very sad coz my Lolo passed away 2 years ago & Lola can't moved on coz they've been together for 62years then I realized after my husband's birthday when is the time that I'm going to give flowers to my loved ones when they already in their graveyard??? that is why i decided to give my Lola a bunch of flowers to divert her attention to the flowers and not to think about my Lolo's death. My mom said my Lola cried because of Joy not because she feels so alone in their anniversary also my Mom cried because she's the one who read the card message for my Lola... This made me convinced that there is a real power of Joy whenever someone sends you flowers... I also loved about this shop is they have the message card that they includes in the package.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Travel Back in Time With Retro Flight,"I booked my family with Philippines Airlines (PAL) because it's the only available direct flight between London Heathrow and Manila PH so we thought we'd give it a try.First, we chose the best price for the outbound and return journey. Only thing is, at the 'last minute' the flight was delayed - cancelled - and rebooked to fly a day later. The reason was 'operational reasons' which to me means, there were not enough passengers booked on the given day so we were all squeezed onto the next day. I was assured this would not affect the return journey, but then ... 3 weeks later, exactly the same thing happened and the return flight was delayed by a day also. You can imagine what this all meant for the logistics of our stay. That summarises the reliability of PAL airlines.Secondly, the planes are quite small for long-haul jets, and quite old. NO monitors in the seats etc and the tv monitor that was on board was at the front of the entire section and was an old CRT monitor so I'd assume these planes must be from the 1980's at the very best. Being fair, the cabin staff handed out tablets to all who want them for movies and music in exchange for your boarding pass.On completion of the return journey I investigated whether there was any recourse for these delays. Indeed, I found that if you fly from any EU country, each passenger is entitled to 600 euros compensation for a 24 hour delay. However, for the return journey from Manila to Heathrow, as it's not flying FROM the EU Philippines airlines simply ignore you and it's just something you have to put up with. Therefore it appears to me that there is no PAL company integrity or customer care in reality, PAL only pay out of they're legally obliged to regardless of what losses have been incurred to you as a customer.In addition, when PAL are in the process of negotiating the compensation claim they sent a waiver for each passenger to sign. One paragraph says that you agree not to make any other claims against PAL which I amended to indicate that this waiver related to the flight number in question ONLY otherwise it could be interpreted as good for any PAL flight ever. Really badly worded, maybe intentionally? I don't know. Still, I did highlight this to customer services who didn't seem to care much.In summary, I would travel using PAL if I want a direct flight in very basic conditions. I know now that if I fly from the EU and get stuck with a delay then I can claim amounts up to 600 euros per passenger. I just need to ensure all communication is done via email to PAL which is laughingly addressed: Wecare(at)pal.com.ph",2,8-Jul-17,1,GB,NULL,Jul,7,2017

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Avoid Philippine Airlines At All Costs,"I can say one thing only, stay away from Philippine Airlines at all costs!It is now the End of November and we are abck from our trip for weeks and to date Philippine Airlines has never reached to discuss our horrible experience, please share my experience and be aware of just how horrible Philippine Airlines truly is.My wife and I have used EVA, Korean Airlines, Cathy Pacific, Air Canada, Hawaiian Airlines, Air France and many others and in all my years of flying I have never had such a horrible experience.We booked our trip to the Philippines through Expedia just like most of our hotel and flight's packages.  We booked around 5 months in advance and the lovely journey began.  We have our profiles setup in Expedia that give us seating option preferences and they have always been fulfilled.  This time around we book our trip and come to find out our seat assignments were not only incorrect, they have seating my wife and myself in different locations on the planes, to and from LAX and Cebu.  To say the least that was shocking, what do these people think, we want to do 12 plus hour flights separated, have Expedia and Philippine Airlines lost their minds?I reached out to Expedia and waited about a half and hour or so to get a customer service rep., average time to reach support in another country now is at least 15 to 45 minutes or more.  After explaining the situation and going back and forth they insisted it was out of their hands and I would have to reach out to Philippine Airlines directly.  So, I proceeded to contact Philippine Airlines and waited to reach a rep., I asked them why this happened and of course no one can give me a direct answer.  I also told them we require an isle seat and wanted bulkhead seating for more legroom.  The said it was be extra, not only for the bulkhead but also for the isle seating.  I have never had to pay for an upgrade to isle seating, I was quite upset but paid and extra $410 for the isle and bulkhead seating to the Philippines and Back to Los Angeles.Throughout the next several months Philippine Airlines continuously kept changing our flight times and with each change we had longer and longer lay-overs in Manilla to and back from Cebu.  I reached out time and time again to both Expedia and Philippine Airlines and Expedia would send an email to Philippine Airlines as they say it was the only way to reach someone over there.  On one occasion though we were moved to level 2 support with Expedia and after spending hours explaining our situation and frustration he said there was a direct phone line he could use, he tried to reach out and found out he would have to wait until Monday and call then and get back to me.  The next day I never heard back from Expedia and a couple days later I receive one of their boiler plate template email telling me we submitted, and email and they would get back to me in 2 weeks.  Over the course of the next 4 months they flights kept getting changed and I kept reaching out to both companies, and always ended up with the same results no one can do anything and we have to wait for email response and guess what, there were never any responses.We are finally in October and under a week until our trip and yet again there has been another flight change from Cebu, to Manilla to Los Angeles, now with a 17 hour lay over in Manilla.  This has to be a joke or something you would think so I am back on they phone with Philippine Airlines, they say again there is nothing they can do I have to reach out to Expedia so I do and again they say they have to submit and email to them and wait.As a customer I feel that neither one of these companies care about me or my wife and they can only come up with excuses, so I wait again for anyone to response.It is finally the day of our Travels and we go to check into our flight with Philippine Airlines and guess what they have no record about our isle seating or upgraded seating arrangements or any proof of payment.  I explained the entire story to them and what a nightmare it has been, so I asked them to please help us.  They said we are so sorry but sorry nothing we can do.  Are you for real guys, and of course I didn't print out the receipt from the phone payment I made to Philippine Airlines I didn't realize they were this incompetent, I should have been aware with all the other problems.  I went ahead and paid for the upgrade a second time but at this point didn't get bulkhead jut and area with a bit more legroom.At this point I have wasted over 36 hours of my life not counting the time my wife and I discussed off the phone these issues and the overall stress this whole experience has caused us.",1,29-Nov-19,2,US,NULL,Nov,11,2019

If you do not have the capacity to do your job right, then don’t take up so many orders! Do not come up to me and say that ""due to COVID, we have many order...."" Don’t push everything to COVID! You people chose to throw away my parcel without consulting me first. Educate your people, take responsibility for what your people do. Not try to bring down the issue by giving just a mere $50. It cannot even cover 1/6 of it!Firstly, the parcel was collected in good condition. If there was any leakage, your people would have already notice it when he picked up the parcel.It was indicated on the parcel that the item was fragile, written using a marker. The customer service blamed me for not putting a fragile sticker on my parcel, and it being written on the parcel is not enough… Anyways, fragile sticker pasted or not, that does not give you the right to mishandle parcels like that. Moreover, the pictures you have given me does not show that the leakage was from MINE item. Yes, I saw that there were water marks on your carton box, but in your picture my product was dry, the label and the paperbox was dry, not stained, or wet like how a soaked label would look like. It was double wrapped with a plastic PE film over the product and bubble wrapped a second time, there were zero fluid seen in my packaging in your photos. So, where did that leakage come from? I am not sure if your guy checked before deciding my parcel had to be thrown away. Also, I gave you my numbers when I put up the order. I assumed it is basic courtesy to contact me before doing any decision concerning my parcel. But no, your people just choose to throw it away. Is that how your SOP works? Is throwing customer’s parcel away part of your SOP?The reason you gave: Because we have no idea if it is a chemical. It might be dangerous. Utter NONSENSE. Is throwing chemical in a regular bin part of your SOP too? Don’t you know you have to dispose chemicals the proper way? Should I get an NEA officer to check on your company too? Sidetracked…Anyway, your people could have informed me. No one called me. I have to call up every single day to ask about my parcel. The case has been dragged for over a month now. The only progress I had was when the manager said they can compensate $50 over a call today. Mind you, my products cause more than $300. I was stupid to trust your company with my expensive products. Honestly, I wished I had never passed anything to your company. You failed your task, threw away my item and do not wish to take any responsibility for it. ($50 does not mean anything, why not I give you $50 instead and you return me my stuff?)I am trying to see if I can bring up the case to anyone.

It is understandable if it is no longer within the working hours or it is a non working day. Is Thursday at 01:00PM not a working day/hours in the Philippines?

We’ve had numerous problems with our internet connection fluctuating from 30 Mbps to a constant 3-5 Mbps. They said it’s a problem with the line of our building but have never bothered to fix it. It’s been almost 6 months since the issue surfaced, and it hasn’t been put into an end. Not to mention, the days (even weeks) we have to wait for such an issue to be addressed.I would definitely not recommend PLDT for those people looking for a good internet service provider.

For my landline, I am using PLDT landline plus on a P300 monthly prepaid plan. No problem as there's no interaction with PLDT staff whatsoever. The key here is to stop dealing personally with PLDT customer services  as they cause more stress and perhaps even more death than Corona virus.

After payment confirmation, they sent an email saying that it is holiday season, so they will deliver my flowers on the 4th of November instead. In the first place, they could already block those holidays if they are not able to deliver. Don't take my money and then apologise for the inconvenience. Then, on the 4th of November, they just dropped the flowers in some part of Sanctuarium. None of my family even knew where the flowers were. Flowerstore isn't a business that cares for your emotions.

I already mentioned that my home is far from origin branch so I can't easily go there to correct their mistake, especially in this pandemic BUT they just kept telling me to go to origin branch. Is it that hard to check on LBC's database so they can just tell me where the heck the document is right now? I told them that it's urgent but no, they are unwilling to assist me. Junk service. Just because your agents made a mistake, I have to correct it by going to origin branch? I have to make ADDITIONAL EXPENSES for LBC's mistake? Wow.

PawnHero & Marketplace,4.2,Great,Should have gone to a normal pawnshop instead,"I had my laptop picked up by their messenger last Thursday, April 21, 2016. I received an email from them that they have already received my laptop the following day. I waited the following week to get my loan. However, 3 days later (not counting Saturday and Sunday) I am still waiting for their email or text that my loan has already been remitted to my cash card. I decided to email them just to check if they are processing my loan. To my surprise, they emailed me that I need to send them a copy of my ID and cash card. The reason behind that is the messenger took crappy pictures of my ID and cash card. No one contacted me to tell me that hey we have a slight hiccup processing your loan. I would appreciate that I get updates if something like that comes up. I was blindsided because I was thinking that there was no problem with the appraisal of my laptop and I would get the money within 24 to 48 hours. I pawned my laptop because I needed the money badly. But because of what happened I ended up having to borrow money from my friends which was embarrassing. I needed the money yesterday April 26, 2016. What if this was a life and death situation? Someone could have died because they did not have the money to cover their hospital bills. I am really disappointed with the way you handled my account. I will never recommend you to any of my family members and friends needing quick cash to pay or cover for something. You are claiming that we can get the loans proceeds quickly and it would only take 24 hours for you to remit the loan. But in reality I have been waiting since Monday for you to remit the money. I have no choice but to just wait for you guys to finish appraising my laptop. I knew that this business model isn't ideal but I decided to give it a try and I was very disappointed with the end result.

I actually sent pictures clearly showing the color difference of the original and what was receive but obviously your ""Dispute Resolution"" team didn't even bother to look.I contacted customer service and the lady said she had 3 simultaneous chats going. I asked her to concentrate with me and her ultimate response was to work it out with the seller who rejected my claim in the first place!This is really shameful, if you are contacted immediately upon receipt of the item and a return is requested then it should be honored. No questions asked.To automatically favor sellers over customers, and long term customers with an excellent track record at that, is poor business practice. You are basically complicit in ripping me off.And your standard response will be the canned reply you send to everyone here to contact you via social media or blah, blah, blah.I've contacted everyone contactable at Lazada and no one seems to appreciate that an injustice has been done.Utterly shameful.

It will come and past, and get rescheduled - in some cases, multiple times. Their delivery people all seem to be self employed and badly trained in dealing with customers. Goods get collected from merchants but they goes to a warehouse “purgatory” for a while. Singapore being such a tiny island should not require 4-6 days to deliver an item! Once I received an item with a hole in the box and I could see through the item colour was obviously incorrect (I ordered a black desk and was delivered a white one) so I rejected the delivery but the driver was reluctant to take it back, in fact cooked up an excuse that I had created the hole in the box!

None of the shirts I have ordered have been all cotton.  They are partly polyester (plastic) and therefore hot and sticky in humid Thailand.  Moreover, when you try and place a review on Lazada that tells the truth, Lazada immediately takes your review down.  In other words, the exact opposite of Amazon, where you can read the bad reviews along with the good ones.   This is how Asians often deal with problems:  pretend they don't exist.  But the problem is, Lazada will lose customers this way.  Amazon has faithful customers because the customers can see for themselves what other customers say.  Lazada thinks censoring their customers is the way to go.   Is that smart? By doing this Lazada will sell a few dozen more 'bath brush with long handle' and fake ""100% cotton"" shirts but they will lose customers for life. Also, I advise you if buying from Lazada to consider at least hesitating when it says ""product shipped from abroad"", which usually means China.  You cannot do COD on those orders so it is not practical to open the box in front of the delivery person, then refuse the item (because you've already paid for it).

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,One of the worst airlines,I have travelled on many airlines and this has to be one of the worst. I have travelled with this airline quite a few times and would say that the service is nothing special - it’s not good or bad. But my experience the last two times I travelled I realized how lousy the service has become. The staff don’t care about you - they chat with each other and aren’t really doing their jobs. They should also try their best to make sure the customer is happy but they don’t care. Any other airline would be better for their service (except maybe Delta domestic in the US). But PAL has really gone down. Service is just horrible. If you just want to get from point A to B then this airline is ok - don’t expect them to care about giving you a service or anything though.

The first transaction took 12 days and numerous calls to prove to them that there WAS a transaction. The second transaction is now on day 4 and the first rep I talked with claimed that the name of my mother in law was not the correct name!

I called again and the rep stated that the MTCN number doesn't exist yet I am looking at their website that says the transaction is ready for pickup!After I kept asking how to fix this issue the rep said ""oh! it looks like the money is ready for pickup today!"" He then said my mother in law needs to pick it up by today. And then he said if she can't pick up the money to call the consignment center to talk to their reps..The person I send money to should not have to call anyone while trying to collect their remittance!I believe this company purposely creates an issue to hold onto the money to collect the extra interest.

I contacted customer service and not only was I accused of violating the terms and condition, but was also replied in a very rude way. First off i have no idea how i could've violated anything having owned my account for such a short period of time. After only my first email asking why i couldn't use my voucher, i was replied by such an ill-mannered employee who explicitly said ""your account is suspended. The decision is final."" and then proceeded to tell me tell me I've violated the Terms and Conditions in the same email and finally deciding to end my query, without me being able to ask any further questions or even send a replying email. Abruptly ending queries made by customers shows that they have no interest on working on consumer satisfaction, even when it takes as little effort as sending emails. Also, saying ""The decision is final."" is so audacious seeing as i was not even going to negotiate on my account being suspended, because why bother? There are tons of online shopping platforms way better than shopee. Why would consumers ever want to support a platform that only cares about the needs of its advertisers and disregards people who actually ""funds"" their business.

PawnHero & Marketplace,4.2,Great,Smartphone pawning through PawnHero,"I needed cash so I decided to pawn my iPhone 7 128 gb using PawHero. The process was of pawning was actually very easy. The PawnHero courier picked up my item on the date I chose, on the same day I got a text message that PawnHero received my item, and then I got another text message that my loan was approved. The initial offer online (1 month loan duration) was Php16,000+, but the final appraisal was only Php12,000. I think the appraisal was a bit a low given my iPhone 7 was in very condition, less than 6 months, complete with accessories, and had the original box. But I still accepted their offer since they already have my item and I needed cash badly. I accepted the offer on Friday afternoon and I got the money on my bank account on Monday night.Paying the loan was also easy, but knowing how to do it was the tricky part since I didn't sign up for an account when I pawned my item. I had to contact PawnHero's customer service to get the link to the pawn ticket page. I payed my loan through BDO over-the-counter deposit (Dragonpay), then I uploaded a copy of the deposit slip on PawnHero's payment confirmation page. I got a payment confirmation from Dragonpay within a few hours after depositing the money. However, I didn't get any email/text confirmation or update from PawnHero. A day after I paid, I got a text message from the PawnHero courier that he's already on his way to my address! PawnHero should have at least informed/updated me that they are already returning my item. I had to tell the courier to reschedule the delivery of the item since I wasn't home that time.

I deliberately ordered it from a shop that was about 8 km from my house so they could get it here ( if lucky) the same day.

They said they tried to deliver at 10pm at night and had a photo! the photo was of daytime. They said it would be delivered the next day urgently, it wasn't. They Close on SundayThey said it would be priority one on Monday... if it was it means nothing was done at all for any customer.... it did not leave the warehouse.  Then they said their were too busy to deliver it. Customer service are nice enough but when you call they have zero power to make anything happen. (41 emails, 5 phone calls and a manger telling the warehouse to deliver it made no difference) They are not fit for purpose.In my opinion they got annoyed at me asking where is my parcel and decided to keep it to hurt me. It worked, i was on Home quarantine without the means to work and it has lost me a lot of money. They did promise yesterday, which i knew would be a mistake, it would have been 3 days then. Which would have fitted their 'rules' however seeing as it was 8km away they took longer than if i had tapped the laptop to a turtle and pointed it in the correct direction.

They did however send me a screenshot showing the delivery receipt signed by someone. The thing is nobody came to my house and the name of the signature is nobody I know - the name is of nobody in my house or subdivision.  They cannot even blame a contract courier error as it was ""delivered"" by their own Lazada Express service. Previously with other Lazada orders, the courier will text you and say they will be delivering the item soon to make sure you are at home. However, this time there was no such text. This makes me think someone internally within their organization has stolen the item. As of yet my issue is unresolved and means I am out of pocket a substantial sum and no product to show for it. I have 5 active Customer Service tickets which are unresolved. They claim to return communication within 24-48 hours but they never do. I have also called their Customer Service hotline 4 times, spending over 700 PHP in load in the process. They keep fobbing me off saying they are looking into it. I have had no contact back from them apart from ""stock answer"" emails saying they will be in touch. Quite frankly they do not care about their customers. I would strongly advise caution when using this site, especially if you pay in advance.

Samsung service then provided me with a written certificate officially stating this was a fake product not manufactured by them. I included this in the dispute. Lazada then instructed me to return the product to the seller But there was no longer any mention of a refund. When I asked them to reassure me in writing that when I return the counterfeit product that I would receive my refund,They refused. They now told me that it was the decision of the seller and if I disagreed, I could file another dispute. So both the seller and Lazada are not truthful to the buyers.

Shopee said to send it back but to return it I had to drive to the city plus spend 300+ php in shipping, more than the item cost. I purchased the item COD so I basically wrote it off as a loss. I'll be sure to avoid Shopee in the future and recommend that others do the same. If you have to buy from them use a credit card. At least then one can dispute the transaction.

They also changed their routines to prevent it from happening again and also informed the webmasters to fix the technical issues with the homepage. On top of that they made an express delivery of the flowers to my girlfriend with their finest roses in a nice box and with a discount card and then they also gave me a refund for it.

Only Lazada knows my information that's how they manage to call us. The next day Lazada message us that our order was cancelled"" items did not pass quality standard of Lazada and suspicious"". Although the payment was outside Lazada platform the transaction/conversation was within Lazada app not with seller but someone pretending to be a Lazada customer service.. We asked for assistance and refund since we are scammed via Lazada app but they just sent us an email that they are sorry and will not refund. Lazada is should be responsible for this first; Lazada  ensures customer account is secured but in our case someone got our contact number and second; Lazada app is safe but it is not since someone used Lazada chat (logo and name customer service) to scammed us. Third; Lazada ensure they don't tolerate fraudelent seller yet after few days We stumbled a post to beware of  someone from Lazada trying to scam the post was exactly like what happened to us like same seller, same Lazada customer service chat which happens early year of 2021 and us scammed Oct of 2021. Why Lazada dont take action of this when they cancelled my order due to suspicious item/seller. They allow scammers on Lazada or A scammer is working within Lazada.Lazada app is not secured. And leave a customer vulnerable, Lazada will turn their backs on the customers that made them. If they don't compensate us in anyway we will file a complaint to DTI.

Sendflowerstophilippines,4.2,Great,"Abysmal service.  I have used this company twice, I should have learned the first time.","I placed an order at a cost of £45 for what looked like a beautiful Valentines Day gift for my girlfriend using this company on Friday 6th February 2015, to be delivered of course on the day, Saturday 14th February 2015.  You can imagine my disappointment when the day came and went and no gift had been received.  I immediately emailed sendflowerstothephilippines.net to express my disappointment and I asked for a full refund.  Two days later I received a response stating that, and I quote, ""The delivery address is for pick up and we tried to discuss this with the recipient of your order but failed as were unable to reach the recipient at the contact number provided"".  I replied with the telephone number in question (which incidentally was exactly the same as the one used on the order) and also supplied an email address for my girlfriend.  I cannot accept this as a reasonable excuse for the gift not being delivered on time.  I also pointed out that they had my number and my email address and that they could have contacted me instead if they were having difficulty.  I also emphasised that the whole effect of having the gift delivered on Valentines day had now come and gone with nothing having been done and that I had been left feeling utterly dissatisfied with the service.  I should point out at this point that I also used the company to deliver flowers on my girlfriend's birthday in June last year and they weren't delivered until July!  After that experience I should have known better than to use the company again but I did recall that the order, once received, had been beautiful and I put it down to a one-off error and decided to give them a second chance.  But back to my Valentine's order... On Tuesday 17th I received a response and again I quote, ""The details have been noted and we will get back to you in case we have any trouble in delivering the same. Feel free to contact us in case you require any further assistance on the same. P.S. Orders being constantly delayed can be due to genuine reasons and not due to constant error"".  Judge for yourself but I found this response wholly unsatisfactory.  Oh, and of course not an apology in sight.  And no mention of a refund or any compensation for the errors caused.  Merely an attempt to justify the ""constant errors"" (to use their own words) made.  Talk about stating the obvious!!  I replied to this email requesting that the matter be raised to a higher authority within the company but as yet I have yet to receive the courtesy of a response.  The latest development, today (18th February) is that my girlfriend received a text message, ""We have a delivery for you but are unable to complete the delivery due to remote address, if you are willing to collect at nearest LBC branch in your place pls text me LBC branch and reference number"".  12 hours ago this information was texted back and a text message was instantly received saying, ""Checking"".  Since then, it's silence on all fronts.  That's my experience of sendflowerstothephilippines.net.  Judge for yourself if you would be prepared to lose your money and receive such disappointment in return.

LBC Express,1.2,Bad,I really don’t know what to say…,"I really don’t know what to say anymore, LBC is failing on its promise. Written on the company website is its vision, LBC committed to “becoming the access and delivery solutions provider of choice by 2020”, going on to say, “through a well-rounded customer experience”.   As it is now 2020 that vision written four years ago LBC is falling a very long way short of its aims. LBC is not consistently improving its operations and customer service let alone the overall customer experience, why? Because waiting 4 months for a package collection is a joke!!!!",1,20-Jan-20,1,AE,NULL,Jan,1,2020

PLDT,1.1,Bad,I really had a very very bad experience…,"I really had a very very bad experience with PLDT as a whole. And when I say as a whole, that includes even the customer service representatives we talked to. Now, let's start with the service itself. Speed was good at the beginning until last 2 weeks. Yes, most of the time we pay our bills 2 to 3 days late but that should not be the reason why we are now having a poor service. If only we have other options in our area, we would rather not choose PLDT because we already heard all the feedback from other customers. But then again, we have no choice. I just don't understand as to why this company never improves despite of all the bad feedback. False advertisements and unprofessional customer service representatives. When making a possible sale, they are so good and so nice to talk to and make you feel like you are talking to a friend. But after the connection, they can't handle complains from customers. Even their Technical experts are not experts. They're just there so you have someone to talk to as ""Technical supports"". This was the funniest moment when we talked to them:ME: We are having a very bad service.Agent: Because we are having system enhancement.Me: What kind of enhancement.Agent: Basta, yung enhancement na di nyo makikita sa end nyo.(Like W*F???!!.)I also worked as a customer service representative in an International company. It just saddens me how I get this kind of treatment from my own country. ALL LIES!You even said sa advertisement nyo that we can connect 5-10 devices. But the agen up to 6 because of the enhancement. Nagmamadan pa nga sya kasi ayaw ata matanong ng matanong at baka magkamali. HAHAHA!It's just so weird. Soon sana nga magkatotoo that we will have another service provider from out of the country para magsara na company nyo. Napaka worst talaga ng service.

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,Management is lacking...,"I really wanted it to be a good grade but the flowers were almost 4 hours late and it was her birthday. The reasoning was the delivery guy from Lalamove apparently didn't pick up the flowers from the store. If that was the case, why didn't anyone book another rider to deliver it in the 4-hour span it was just on the store.The flowers were beautiful but as it arrived at almost nighttime, the sunflowers were soft and almost wilted. The rider apologized as she was only one of the few company riders and I understand it wasn't her fault. She said that she had to come back from a delivery to the store then get my package to deliver to me.Anyway, flower quality fine but management and customer support (who has been telling me that the rider is on the way for the whole of that 4 hours in which I have email proof) are severely lacking. If a problem rises, please tell your customer instead of making hollow promises and lying. I'll still order again in the future but if it doesn't work out then so be it.

Looking forward to it.Fast forward, I received a call from their manager a week after and was told I should have reviewed the T&C's and it's not their shortcoming. I did call and email them almost everyday that their system is not accepting my payments and this was justified with 3 screenshots that my AMEX acknowledged 3 pending posting ftom my account.I was told that they already put corrective measures to their concerned employee and I'll be placed into a special pricing scheme category. This is not customer service at its best. Lastly, I was told that he will appreciate it as much if I can delete this review since this will be a concern for them. Totally not classy at all...

So, I have purchased tons of stuff during their Revolution Sale last December 2017. I have ordered a couple of clothes, makeup, and more, but they have failed to deliver it all. First, they failed to deliver the Ashley Shine Matte Lipsticks set that I bought under the order # 321271951, and what triggers my anger is that I have paid for it. I have immediately returned the oval puff which I have purchased along with the said product and it took them more than 2 weeks before they found the lost product. Meanwhile, they have initiated a refund on the oval puff since they have failed to deliver it a replacement for the said item. What disappoints me is that up until now I haven't received any update about it and that no refund was there to pick up on LBC. The tracking # that their payment team sent me is not active. I have waited for 5hours for them to unlocked the key, and yes I did go home with nothing. I have been talking to tons of agents for 3weeks and nobody has resolved my concern. They all have the same spill, but their messages were full of lies. I hate liars and with that, I hate the Chat Support Team of Lazada. Up until now, I am still hoping for the refund and for the products that I have purchased from Taobao(btw, they have cancelled my order as they wony be able to deliver it on my address).. I admit that I became rude towards the conversation, but trust me when I say that it is also tiring waiting for them to do what they are paid for. It is exhausting, hearing that we will coordinate with the ... team, please expect a feedback after 24-48hours or maybe they mean 24 to 48days. I have set my own deadline for them to assist me with my concern and don't just set it aside. I guess that this will be the last time that I will make a transaction with them for I don't want to feel so desperate and stress anymore. So guys, let's just wait for the launch of Amazon PH.Also, I have experience being harass by one of their couriers, he is asking me for a tip after delivering my orders at home as it is out of their service coverage. He keeps on calling me as well, and he said foul words which I hated the most. I have immediately blocked his number as I am so scared of this big fat dude.

Don't focus too much on the testimonials online because they will not cater to your emergency if your item is less than 15k. Do you think clients pawn their precious items just for fun? No. They need to pawn their precious items because of emergencies and life events that need urgent cash. Website and online process appears to be efficient but the lack of transparency is not only a turn off but a complete waste of time for people who are in a bind.

Of course, all the people we need to speak to were not available until Monday. So in affect we have been given one working day. As a result, damages have been incurred.The Civil Aviation Authority says airlines should always tell passengers at least 14 days in advance - moneysavingexpertWe were offered to fly a day before, a day later or a refund. Flying earlier = higher hotel costs especially because it is last minute.Flying later = paying for a night in a hotel that we didn't stay in and losing a day of holiday.Refund = lose all the money paid for hotels or pay for a more expensive flight with another airline. This is disgraceful.[Update]Philippine Airlines claim that they told the booking agent, emailflights 10 days before that it had been cancelled. This is still way too short notice as stated by the CAA.[Return journey]On the return journey back to the UK. The transfer flight was from the Philippines. Initially, it looked like they had moved our seats even after we had selected them at the online check-in. What actually happened was much worse. It wasn’t that they had moved my seat they thought I was a completely different passenger and gave me his boarding pass. This would have been a nightmare if I had not noticed and tried to board the plan or immigration as I left airport for a few hours. The actual plane and attendants were fine.

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,YOU DONT EVEN DESERVE A STAR,"I wish I can give 0 stars. So disappointed. I ordered from Zalora and was excited to get a text that the items are going to be delivered 2 weeks before the expected date. The moment I got the message, I've been trying to reach their office (ninja van) to give further instructions about my location, since Zalora only allows a few characters to be typed in for the ""marker"". I called a lot of times, but no one's picking up, I've been messaging their facebook but only got automated replies; I waited even for an agent since the concerns I had were not on the options, but I guess no one's there to even check my messages. I had no choice but to wait and have my fingers crossed--I waited the whole day, stayed by the door to make sure I'll be able to see it if anyone comes, but alas, not a sign of them. By the end of the day, I got a message that they got to the address but I wasn't there. So I knew they failed to locate the address. Moving forward, I decided to change the address instead but the link they've given can't locate (not even one) of the addresses I tried typing in. There's an option where you can type in specific details of your address, but something's wrong with the form, I cant type on the space allotted for the street which makes the search futile, plus it wont let you search unless you type it in, so it led me nowhere. Now I don't know if I'll ever get my order.

LBC Express,1.2,Bad,LBC ROBINSON LIPA,"I would like to make a complaint about my transaction in the LBC-Robinson Lipa branch. August 27 I went to LBC and inform the teller that I want to send 2 employee ID to MACAU and he asked me which country because he cannot find Macau in his system so I told him that Macau is part of China and I have written the complete address which indicates Macau, China. I've patiently waited for him for about 20 minutes because he said his a newbie and not familiar with the international transactions. He kept asking his colleague beside him and his manager whos on a meal break. he also has an issue with my recepient because he mentioned that ELAINE CHAN has the same name in their system with a record. All those things were fine for me but in the end, he told me that he can only encode PORTUGAL so he can input MACAU in the address and I told him I don't have any idea about your system just make sure it will be sent to MACAU CHINA OK?  he says sure, and his colleague beside him knows the VENETIAN MACAU that's why even I saw in receipt Portugal I did not worry because I've written the full correct address. So when I got home my husband asked me why I paid 2390 pesos for the shipping fee, I told him it's international that's why it is expensive but he is not convinced so he checks in LBC website if the amount is correct and it turns out that I should pay 840 pesos only. And my husband found out that the 2390 pesos fee is for Portugal in Europe not in Macau. So the next day I went back to LBC-Robinson LIpa and told his manager what happened, his manager apologized which is good and she mentioned she has already emailed the issue and I just need to wait till Monday (August 31) for the parcel to be returned and void the transaction so they can give me back the excess payment. And guess what happened on August 31? the manager just sends me a message saying my parcel is not yet returned because it has been forward to DHL even they already request to HOLD and RETURN my parcel. It is September 3 today and I have not received any update about my issue, I will go back to LBC-Robinson  Lipa again to check what happens. Please do something with my complaint, they give me so much trouble and delay already. TRACKING NO 191393235241  ,",1,3-Sep-20,1,PH,NULL,Sep,9,2020

Lazada,1.5,Bad,Will Never Order from Lazada Again,"I would not trust Lazada to carry out my trash can, I made a big mistake and ordered from them. My order is more than a month on the way. And all I get from their support ticket system is lies and hot air.  Even the tracking number they sent me is not working! When pointing this out. Lazada support had the never (and incompetence) to ask me to file an investigation with the courier. Excuse me? you messed up and want me - who is paying you - to sort out your mess? I never get any real information from Lazada. Whenever I send in a support ticket I get one of 5 copy paste replies telling me how sorry they are and thanking me for my understanding and of course ""sorry for the inconvenience"". It is a lot easier just to copy paste these never ending blah-blah emails instead of actually trying to find out what happened, where my shipment is and giving me correct and reliable information. Hiring a bunch of apologizers as your support team will never make anyone look good, try to get support staff with an actual brain, who actually tries to help your customers instead of just sending out email after email apologizing for their ineptitude.  The only thing I understand is how incompetent these people are and how they treat paying customers. My luck in this case is that I ordered DOC, Cash on Delivery, so at least I dont have any actual cash out on this deal. But the monumental waste of time and effort plus of course the wait before I can use the items I want to purchase is more than enough for me. I mean what would happen if I actually got the item and paid for it. And then found out it did not work? If Lazada can not handle a simple delivery, then how on earth would they be able to handle any kind of returns or warranty. So I do NOT trust them and I will never ever order from them again!",1,13-Mar-16,1,US,NULL,Mar,3,2016

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,I'll tell you my story from February…,"I'll tell you my story from February 21, 2020 when I arrived at Manila airport.Let's start by purchasing my Toronto - Manila ticket. I contacted your Toronto sales office in December for information on transporting a dog. I have been very well informed. I asked several questions about his departure and arrival given the size of his cage (30x42x56 inches), where to go at the airport in Toronto and where to pick him up in Manila also how it would be treated. I was told to go to the extra luggage counter that they are used to transporting animals and they are treated very well. For Toronto, everything went very well, it was taken care pretty well. For Manila, it was just the opposite.On the plane, I asked again where I should go to pick up my dog ​​who was in a very large cage. Nobody knew what to answer to me. I was told when I leave the plane agents will be there to assist me.I get out of the plane, ask where to go and I was told it will be next to carousel 4.I went to the carousel, no dog. I'm told to go to the quarantine office. No one was in the office, I waited. Someone arrived, I asked where is my dog, he told me that he did not know. I went back to the carousel, asked the question again, someone told me he will arrive by the carousel, I explained to him that it is impossible given the size of the cage. Do you really put cages with animals inside by the carousel ??? It is dangerous for the animal to be injured when the cage falls on the carousel. I hope not. He turned over and ignore me…. I'm starting to get a little nervous. I'm going to see other people who seemed to be more aware. I am told that they could not put him through the carousel because of the size…. by the carousel ???…. I must dreamed…..and he’s coming by outside and wait for him there. After 30 minutes, my patience reached its limit. I went back inside, couldn't find the people I talked to. I went to see another person, replied that they don't know how to get my dog ​​up. I kept asking questions because it was incomprehensible that we couldn't bring him up. No one answered me, they talked to each other and I didn't understand anything, I told them to talk to me but no. After several interminable minutes, I lose patience…. I am finally told that I can go down to see him.The shock I got out of the elevator to see all these people gathered around the cage, my dog ​​inside frightened and trembling with his whole body. I don’t even dare to think about the treatment they had giving him since leaving the plane so that he was in this state.Then there were endless discussions, the security who didn't want me to go by the elevator with my dog ​​and all those people around us. I had to get angry and ask to make them leave. I felt like I was in a circus…. After several more minutes, we waited for the chief of security to arrive. Still unnecessary discussions, to finally brought me up by the street.I’m telling you this briefly without all the details, it still lasted 3 hours.I asked if they were aware that I was arriving with my dog ​​in a large cage because I had already asked before I left and I was told that yes they communicated with each other and they are waiting for me. They told me they weren't aware I was coming with my dog. I think I did everything to make this trip to go well with my dog.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,File a complaint with the US Dept. of Transportation,"I'm a longtime customer of Philippine Airlines, but like many others here, my most recent experience has been a disaster.I had a flight scheduled in March 2020. I also applied for a refund, and was told I would get it in two months. Its August now, and after a ton of communication with my travel agency Mangotours and attempted email communication with Philippine Airlines (with no replies, except one guy that didn't even know about my case and directed me back to Mangotours), no refund is in sight.Mangotours claims that a refund must come through Philippine Airlines to my credit card account, and they provided proof/a Refund Exchange Notice that they filed in April, so while I am skeptical of their claims, they have at least communicated with me. Philippine Airlines has said nothing of note.Enough is enough.I thought I would file a chargeback, then realized that too much time had elapsed, since I purchased my ticket last year.The next option I took was to file a complaint with the US Dept. of Transportation. Apparently, Philippine Airlines is obligated to reply to these complaints, but we shall see.To any other disappointed and furious unrefunded customers out there, filing a complaint with the DoT seems to be the best we can do. Getting into a long and brutal legal battle with Philippine Airlines is out of the question for most people.If Philippine Airlines (and affiliates) chooses to prioritize their profits over their customers, they deserve their bad reputation.

LBC Express,1.2,Bad,Rude and Arrogant employee at Robinsons Antipolo,"I'm a regular sender of documents thru LBC, both local and international.This afternoon, I went to your Robinsons Antipolo branch to send five documents (1 international and 4 local). There was a long queue outside because of one customer with so many big items to be sent. I waited for almost an hour. When it's my turn at the counter, the lady employee asked me to fill-up the form, although the details are already in the envelopes, and called the next person in line.At this point, I asked if it is not possible to write on the form while we were waiting outside. The male employee (there was only one male employee inside; they are not wearing their IDs properly) arrogantly told me that I did not asked for the form and they are doing many things.Me: Yes, I know you are attending to a customer with many items but you should also consider the other customers. Just provide them with the form to write the details while on queue.LBC male employee: Bago niyo kami turuan, mag-intern muna kayo dito sa LBC. (before you tell us what to do, apply for internship at LBC first). So rude, really bastos.Me: I'm just providing customer feedback so that the process could be efficient.LBC male employee: Ganyan talaga dito (That's how it is here). (as if telling me that I cannot do anything because this is the way of LBC and customers should just follow).There was no room for further comments to the LBC male employee as he is always right.NOTE: Your employees were not wearing their masks properly, it's in their chins and they are allowing more than 3 customers inside. These are violations of IATF rules.Is this the kind of education of LBC employees? Very baaaad. Maybe, I'll just look for a better alternative.",1,6-Jan-22,2,PH,NULL,Jan,1,2022

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,It's all about driver/rider attitude & the non-claimable mobile phone credit,"I'm an ex-driver for ninja van about 2-3 years ago, and also a lady. Ninjavan always been using a part-timer to be a rider, not their full-time employees. The management for respective hub conducted a simple instruction (one-to-one) to a new driver before starting their first job. It's quite simple and maybe a bit confusing to some of the drivers (maybe for the old-timers & the non-educated person...I'm sorry but to admit this). Because the common sense attitude plays a crucial part in delivering the parcels by the drivers. For the delivery attempt, i'm usually msg/whatsapp/call the customer to inform their delivery items once reached their house (instead of ringing the bell or knocking the gate/door) or when searching their address if it's not accessible by waze/google maps (FYI, the map tracking through ninjavan apps are quite terrible, need to search by my own waze/google maps or call the customer to reach out). I'm working in the rural areas, kampung2 which do not have proper address like in urban/ township area. Yeah it's an effort & common sense too. Once contacted, i'll be dealing with the customer on how to drop their parcel if nobody's home either to put at the specific port around their house, or giving to their neighbour's custody and what not. Usually, I will snap a photo on the parcel location so that the owner will aware of this. Lastly, then the delivery tracking can be completed by putting down the client's ID or signing my signature/ writing off my name with the consent of the customer. Again, to make it all, the driver need to use their own MOBILE PHONE CREDIT (which is NOT CLAIMABLE) to make the sms delivery/ call in which will give some burden to some of us. I think that is the biggest problems why ninja delivery service is very bad in rating & got complaints all the way regarding the driver's attitude & COMMON SENSE.  In other notes, yesterday I've received a parcel delivered by ninjavan (maybe sri petaling area) from the seller. Yeah the delivery was on the same day I received the sms notification on the delivery in the morning. And the driver called me first & took a photo for the delivery proof. It went smooth by the way!     Thank you,Nina from Malaysia",2,"Updated Apr 26, 2020",1,MY,Updated,Apr,4,2020
Globe Telecom,1.1,Bad,Globe internet okay in cities only. Support dreadful.,"I'm an expat working in the Philippines. I can compare Globe Telecom to ISPs in other SE Asian countries. Thailand, for instance, has MUCH better internet infrastructure.Local users say that Globe is the best ISP in the Philippines, but that's only because there's hardly any competition. As with pharmaceuticals and other sectors, telecoms companies are protected from competition. As a result, their services are expensive and still suck.Globe broadband in the core of major cities can be fast and usually reliable. I pay $50/month for 50 Mbps down and actually get about 30 Mbps. The connection was stable... until it wasn't. And then I couldn't get support. Even 9 kilometres out of Metro Manila where I worked earlier today, the only local service Globe offered speed tested at 4.92 Mbps down and just 0.11 Mbps up. The world famous beach at Boracay can't get better than 5 Mbps down... usually less. Globe's non-urban internet reminds me of my dial-up service in Malawi (dirt-poor Africa) back at the turn of the century.If anything at all goes wrong with Globe... account set up, billing, internet technical issues... you're in deep trouble. Globe storefront operations are for sales and bill payments. Other than that, the only way to get support is via telephone. Too bad the front line service reps are so badly trained and supervised. They work off scripts, cannot handle technical questions, promise to elevate the problem and call back. Then they don't. Support was much better in Malawi.Probably the only way to improve internet service in the Philippines is to allow foreign internet companies in to compete. (The Chinese would slaughter Globe, Smart and the minnows, so that won't happen.) Until Globe and the others get a little stick to go with the carrots they're joyfully munching, the Philippines will continue to perpetuate its ""sick man of Asia"" stereotype on all things internet. The Filipinos are wonderful people, so it's too bad that internet infrastructure inferior to neighbouring countries will knock points off economic growth and employment.",1,Updated 17 Aug 2019,1,PH,Updated,Aug,8,2019

So we got nothing and were out of pocket about P200.The other time I ordered a product and everything seemed find, but my wife wanted one too so I went back in and ordered again on the same day - apparently this is a 'warning' sign for them so they cancelled both my orders and AGAIN I needed to be refunded. However, everytime you speak to the LiveChat the guys have absolutely no idea what's going on, they give you crazy excuses which aren't true (""probably because we don't take foreign credit cards"", ""your card won't be charged"", etc...) and it takes a number of attempts to get it sorted out. Ultimately I end up with no product and down by about P200. I swore I'd never order from them again - but my wife saw some makeup she really wanted at a great price, so I decided to risk it just one more time. And I added a GoPro accessories kit to the order at the same time. What happened?? Again, no record of my payment, 5 LiveChats with completely incompetent operators, really slow, and we're still messing around. I decided to change it to COD so that the goods would be shipped before we were leaving home for travels, thinking that I'd be able to contact them and resolve the payment issue before the courier came with the goods.

They keep on telling me to wait for 72 hours for the update but NOT A SINGLE update came. I reached out multiple times but they always tell me that they will make a follow up. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! They provide you a timeframe but they are the ones who don't follow it. WHAT A SHAME. Most of the agents sound scripted and obviously they are NOT DEDICATED TO PROVIDE YOU A RESOLUTION OR TO HELP YOU AT ALL. Very disappointed with Shopee for not showing care to their consumers. VERY SLOW WHEN IT COMES TO RESOLVING AN ISSUE. Their escalation team is worthless as well. NO SENSE OF URGENCY!",1,27-Oct-21,1,PH,NULL,Oct,10,2021

Ok that's acceptable to me so i updated the address to be my residential address instead. After that was 2 times failure in deliveries then the ninja called me up confirming the previous drop off point, like what?? you previously said it cannot be accepted at that collection point due to size constraints. So he asked me an alternative address which i, again, confirmed it to be the residential address instead due to this very issue and it was already supposedly settled 2 days ago. So he was like ok thanks for the confirmation of the new address. Little did i know that this means it will be another day of failed delivery and the reason was passed off as ""customer changed delivery address"", 😕 didn't i already confimed that 4 days ago?? It's also worth noting that i had another delivery of a different item carried out by DHL. It handled international shipping with no hiccups whatsoever, yet this ninja van only handled a local transaction yet it's now delayed by 5 days and still not settled.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,5-star Wannabe with substandard service,"It’s quite difficult on where to start with this as I have always had a lovely picture of Philippines Airlines in my mind because of the 5-star experience that I always got and its mission to deliver a safe, reliable, efficient, and wholesale travel experience, one that captures the heart of the Filipino. I’ve been flying since I was a kid and though not always with Philippine Airlines, I have a pretty good grasp. The experience that I had is not aligned with what this company wants to achieve in the next 12 months.My experience with Philippine Airlines for the past month is a reflection of lack of ownership  and negligence to fulfil one’s duty of care -- a legal responsibility of a person or organisation to avoid any behaviors or omissions that could reasonably be foreseen to cause harm to others; this includes loss and injury.My situation is quite different from most passengers, as I booked a non-revenue ticket for my mom and myself and a revenue ticket for my daughter for her birthday trip. One of their staff members have provided me with misleading information and this has placed me in a situation and this goes without saying where my 12-year old daughter will be forced to fly back home alone which is unacceptable as she is a minor.I have gone to the ticketing office to resolve the issue but the theme of the discussion dwelled on the employees just following the guidelines and just doing their job but this is not the issue. For an airline company, wanting to be a 5-star airline, the experience that you would like to provide your passengers should not stop at it being just transactional, the treatment should not be one-size-fits-all. The ticketing officer may have followed the guidelines but failed to fulfill her duty to make sure that the passenger does not end up having financial loss or emotional stress from having to have her daughter travel alone  all because of her negligence.I have written a formal complaint and followed up multiple times. My emails and phone calls have been ignored by the two managers so I had to constantly follow up on their hotline and no one was able to help. I have flown with so many different airlines and by far this is the most heartless airline I have ever encountered. They would rather have passengers take the blow for their shortcomings. I’ve flown with budget airlines who gave 5-star service but this airline who is wanting to be a 5-star airline gave me budget and substandard service; it makes me sick.  This airline does not deserve to even be recognised by Skytrax.",1,16-Sep-19,3,PH,NULL,Sep,9,2019

Checked phone logs, nobody called me at all.Called up customer service and asked what the hell happened.They said that rider could not reach the home and my phone.1. There were definitely people at my home and they said themselves that they did not receive any call whatsoever. There were 3 people sitting outside at the living room and the phone from the guardhouse could be heard throughout the house. 2. Rider said he tried to reach me but no response. Checked my phone, nobody called me at all. So, ninjavan, since your drivers can’t deliver for nuts, why not have a feature where they just leave the parcel there and take a picture? Instead of just bringing the item back to your warehouse, and have the process repeat again. Or just leave it at some pop station. I am heavily disappointed with your rider.

As I saw from the review, many people have rated it as ""poor."" This problem can cause a major breakdown to your company. If you do not wish to take care of this then many people would not suggest your company and would make them sure to bring this company down. Please take care of this problem, especially many people are having business through internet. I know PLDT is not the only WiFi we have in the Philippines, but I've been using this for three years. I'd be happy to switch if you don't  fix the problem.",1,24-Jul-19,1,PH,NULL,Jul,7,2019

Overall, it was a good experience for me and I consider it a good investment. Just one recommendation to those who are thinking of taking the course - Before fully signing up, I suggest you ask a lot of questions. At the end of the day, you are going to invest a lot of money to take the course. It's best to be aware of the pros and cons right away. Don't forget to do your own research about trading.

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,Extremely incompetent and rude delivery person,"Just had my parcel delivered, TO MY NEIGHBOR! Received a whatsapp from the delivery person saying he delivered my parcel to my neighbor (without my authorization) after he ""knocked loudly"" at my partially opened door and I didn't answer. To be fair I did not hear it as I was in my room working. If he could send me a whatsapp saying he delivered to my neighbor, why can't he first whatsapp me and tell me he was outside? I did reply instantly. By the time i replied he had already left. He then said he will come back and take the parcel back from my neighbor, so i thought that was that and all was good. When he returned he started complaining loudly to my neighbor about me and when i opened my door to get my parcel he rudely shouted angrily at me too complaining that he had knocked on my door very loudly. He also started to complain about how he had to start his day at 6 am. Well, if he wants to complain about that then maybe he should not be working. What an unprofessional and disgusting attitude. If he had the brains to contact me first via whatsapp that he was on his way, or that he was outside with the package, could have avoided all these unpleasantness. Instead he chose to simply assume my opened door means I was not home and could not be bothered and just left my parcel with my neighbor. We don't all have the time or luxury to wait at our doors the whole day for the parcel to arrive. Sometimes we don't hear the knock on our doors due to the circumstance we are in.

When i tell them what has happened they say they will investigate and will let me know within the day. i call back the next day and they say they will let me know after 1 to 3 working days! confusing sms es and emails continue to be sent to me regarding non pick up from pick up point, pick up being too full, delivery location to be home delivery,, etc etc...called lazada to find out where my purchase was. they reply saying I didnt pick up on time??!!!!

Lazada,1.5,Bad,Lazada a fiasco,"Lazada a fiasco!   I am currently in the middle of an order with Lazada Thailand. Unfortunately I relied on general impressions rather than actual fact checking before placing an order online for 9,000 baht. The order was set, I paid for it through a local shop similar to 7-11 and received a delivery date window  within 3 or 4 days.  I started getting concerned when the delivery window passed and checking tracking there was a tiny note - 'no warranty available'.  In follow up e-mails from customer service I also became aware that this was an 'international' ship, not from a Thailand seller.  Now after waiting the second delivery window, which passed with no change to the delivery status I contacted customer service to be told that 'international' shipments take 14 business days.  The 'no warranty', international shipment, and 14 business days  - all information added after the sale and well into the projected delivery projections.  I've called customer service several times to find out where exactly the shipment is. The manager claiming their 'department' cannot be reached, has not given an answer. After repeatedly refusing to wait for them to notify me when they have news the manager did agree to call me back at an agreed time.    He did finally advise me it is a 'cross border' shipment - so likely at a Customs check point at a country border.  But they either don't know or they're not telling.   We discussed my cancelling the order, which they seem very ready and willing to do or refusing the delivery (if it should ever occur).   But since I've all ready paid in advance - how to get my money back?  This cannot be done at their office - it has to be processed, taking at least seven days and I've now read stories of it taking much longer.So, misrepresentations, lies, poor information, extended delays, and the prospect of a protracted return of money.  What if the goods were received and fake, damaged or failed beyond the 2 days they claim you have to make a claim and a return??   The possibilities for protracted misery with customer service, with a claim, with reimbursement while they sit there with my money as leverage!?

So instead of getting the Red version I have no choice but to purchase the black instead. I successfully purchased the item paid by Lazada wallet dated March 29, 2019 to be delivered and get by April 1, 2019 as per Lazada App. Today is Monday April 1, 2019 I followed up thru chat support surprisingly the item is out of stock and they have no idea when is the next delivery date. I ask a support from a supervisor. We ended up routing my orders to other sellers of redmi note 7. But there are price differences. As per Supervisor ""Maine"" they will shoulder the excess amount via exclusive Voucher. I was advise the she will give me an update right away an hour or so. I followed up again thru live chat looking for Maine's update. The chat support representative says Maine is already out of the office, I ask if there's an update logs coming from Maine it says awaiting for approval. I ask the chat support to endorse my concerns to the next supervisor. The chat support intentionally disconnect the live chat. I have no choice but to start over.I opened another live chat support and this time I received a call from Lazada support (Acting Supervisor) surprisingly the acting supervisor can't understand what the issue is all about. Instead he dropped the call just like that.We will pull out all of our products in lazada seller app and discontinued the service.

Lazada,1.5,Bad,Worse experience of my life,"Lazada is a great website at first glance. I bought an expensive item with a 14 days guarantee and the item was defective before that time (lucky for me). I sent back the item and it took a few weeks for the seller to send me a text message saying ""item now ok"". Thinking they fixed it I was happy to receive the item back.  After realising that the item was not fixed I contacted Lazada who told me that there has been a misunderstanding: the seller did not fix anything because they checked the item and they found nothing wrong (item was not starting when I sent it and did not start properly when I got it back). I had to spend 1 hour and 5 minutes (to be precise) on the phone with them before they finally accepted to let a manager handle the case. The guys I had one the phone did not want to let me talk to his supervisor it was crazy.  I received a message the next day saying that they will take the item back under those circumstances and reimburse me under 7 days. I happily sent the package back and asked for news after 14 days of no feedback. I was told that the seller was examining the item before the reimbursement was going to happen. Really Lazada? I told them that the seller was the problem in the first place and asked why they were waiting for their approval. No response.  The next day I received an email from them saying they were very sorry but the seller did not find anything wrong with the item and that it will be shipped back to me.  At this point I was furious and I threaten to sue them because what they were doing was clearly against the law.  After 24 hours I did not receive any answer from them so I sent another email explaining all the proof I had against them. I had a very solid case so I was not going to let it slide (the item was expensive!)I finally received a email from Lazada saying they were sorry and were going to reimburse my item. Never again Lazada! I will use the ridiculously small voucher you gave me to ""make-up"" for your incompetence but I will never buy anything from you after that.  I gave you the small version but Lazada also lied at multiple times trying to make me believe the guarantee was actually 7 days. The seller lied to them but they did not care and sided with them when I am their customer. Terrible! You just lost a valuable customer and I will do my best to warn innocent buyers against you.  Note: I bough from Lazada.co.th, seller: GAME BOY I think I talked to people from the headquarter in the Philippines on the phone but I am not sure.

Giving trust the second time, and true to itself , once is enough, second time is stupidity/foolishness. My item, as per LAzada is on its way, but upon further investigation, which i made myself, calling them all the time, even it is not cheap since i'm not based in the Philippines, i still did. Ninja Van told me that the PAckage has been missing. Ninja Van should never be a partner of LAzada and Lazada should not make any business or just terminate all the employees who is not doing the job well.Losing two orders and yet refunded not fully as they can only refund the amount of the product and not the delivery charge which i never enjoyeed.

We heard the same stories as many others of having to wait 5 billing cycles, it's always 5 regardless of who contacts them or when, it's obviously what the staff are trained to say.Our May 2020 flights were cancelled by them. They acknowledge they owe us nearly £1400 but, will they pay us? Not thus far.We have a solicitor working on them now but their only response to him is that they are passing his 'request' onto their legal team. He's giving it another 8 weeks I think and then it is a full claim against them for the tickets, costs and damages.I suspect we won't see a penny of it though.So many companies are now keeping themselves solvent with customers money they should have refunded and the regulators are doing nothing giving them all a get out of jail card because of covid.I feel sorry for the hard working staff of the airline but, like many things concerning money in the Philippines, it's gone corrupt at the top and they'll get away with it.We have vowed that despite seeing them as our preferred airline previously, this experience has shown to us they cannot be trusted and then we thought about it and, to be honest, we realise we'd had a whole string of bad experiences from them previously with the only positive the time we booked with them but got a code share flight with Emirates instead!",1,2-Nov-21,7,GB,NULL,Nov,11,2021

Learn to Trade Philippines,4.6,Excellent,My Journey with Learn to Trade…,"Looking back since my first day in my LTT journey in learning forex trading, I could honestly say that from LFX 3 day webinar, I have seen my growth. From someone who do not know anything to someone who more or less can now identify and analyze what is happening in the forex market. By attending the UW classes consistently, listening attentively to how the coaches analyze the market with so much passion and clarity, somehow give me the direction on how to  apply personally the strategies by following the checklist provided on how to qualify and select high probability trades. Listening to the different coaches help me to learn the things a master trader must know by attending Master Trader course which I am not entitled to attend. For this I am grateful because attending the live market analysis, trading plan and advanced module courses helped me to understand deeper the many ways in analyzing a good trade. Though I would say it has not been an easy journey too but with the help of my coach, Coach Mameng Duque, who is always ready to accompany me according to my phase, taught me the areas I need to learn and understand more like 2 cycles, support and resistance, how to use fibonnaci, how the different patterns are working and know a little of divergence now. Right now, learning is more my focus than earning a lot now.  It will come later I know. What is important for me now is to enjoy this journey so that I can testify to others that forex trading is the new way of earning money specially to those  who like me are senior citizens already. I also appreciate the use of SmartChart because it is easy to place a trade. No need to compute. But I also learned not to take all the signals it has been presenting. I still need to follow on my checklist in qualifying a good trade. Smart Chart helped me to go thru the different strategies like 180 PC, Trendwave, Volatility reversal, etc. which the manual trading platform would not provide. My overall experience now with LTT in learning forex trading is indeed an experience of gratitude for gaining new learnings, skills, insights and wisdom to become successful forex trader in the near future.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,2 STAR service airline - Customer does not come first,"Looking for 5 STAR  status but still with archaic 2 STAR policies.Booked a flight to leave at 1500 so I could make a quick meeting at 1630 in my destination at the airport before the person I was due to meet left on his flight out.  Philippine Airlines changed my flight time from 1500 to 1650 - no problem with that, I understand that schedule changes happen, so I called them and asked that, in order to get to the meeting I had planned, could they put me on the earlier flight 1055 instead - simple request and all due to their changing their schedules (no fault of mine).  However, because my flight had been changed by less than 2 hours (note: 1 hour 50 minutes so just 10 minutes short of their policy), they would not change my flight.  I asked them to explain to management the situation that I had to make a meeting but still, the upper management would not allow.Philippine Airlines competitors (full-service airlines) understand that their negative actions impact some passengers lives and do what they can to accommodate their needs - but this airline has one foot in the future but one foot firmly staying in the past.  Customers and clients should come first otherwise we will vote with our wallets and use alternative airlines - take accountability when you mess with people's schedules!",1,23-May-18,3,GB,NULL,May,5,2018

Learn to Trade Philippines,4.6,Excellent,How to Find Financial Success through FOREX Trading,"My curiosity was stirred when I chance upon an ad mentioning that we can actually EARN whether the economy is up or----- DOWN? …  I said to myself, how can this be? So I immediately enrolled in their free training, and subsequently, their 3-day “immersion training”.  Aside from the professional trainers and coaches, the training is very informative.  The key is really the coaching/mentoring aspect of the program, as it is not easy to understand and grasp a totally new concept of earning.  The program will not only shorten the learning curve of forex trading, but more importantly, your mentor will give you the proper guidance, the right mindset, and all the encouragement to be a successful and competent trader.   The program will ensure that you find financial success – the Learn –To-Trade (LTT) way.  The journey does not end after the training, but only the beginning of something exciting and fun – while earning….At the comfort of your home, and complete control of your time. Yes, you can actually trade any time of the day 24/5 (hey, 5 days only. The market needs to rest during the weekend also you know).  Scam?  Like anyone who is new and has zero knowledge of this industry, I too -- was skeptical.  But with a legit SEC accreditation, and more than 18 years of solid experience in training, not to mention their numerous awards from prestigious and highly respected review bodies, you are assured of the best --- value-for-money training/mentoring one can have.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,My flight was canceled due to Covid & no refund,"My flight was canceled due to Covid, I originally purchased my ticket through a travel agency, however by re-booking my canceled flight through the airline I was able to request a refund from Philippine Airlines. However, when processing your refund request they request five months to process the refund. I later learned that this time frame is unacceptable. Refunds should typically be processed within a week, not 5 months. After calling over and over for more than a year, I still had not received any refund. Each time I called they would say that it has been forwarded to the refund department but that they could only request to expedite. This however resulted in nothing. I made refund requests both through the myPAL request hub, emails, and over the phone with a rep but I never received any refund despite multiple follow-ups. I even had to file a complaint with DoT in order for them to start processing my refund. After over a year, they emailed me saying a refund was sent and showed details of the processed refund. However, the details did not correspond with the payment method used to purchase the ticket. I emailed the airlines to notify them of the discrepancy and never received a response. I still did not get my refund through PAL this way. I ended up having to file a claim with my bank and was finally able to receive a refund that way, PAL never sent me the refund as they stated they would.

You can't talk to anyone from their customer service but they advertise FLIGHTS and keep TAKING money from people and CANCELS the flight after a week.

The items suddenly became untraceable and an internal investigation was supposedly launched which would 1-3 days to complete.

They have been apologetic all the while, but no breakthrough in locating whereabouts of my parcels pending action by ""the relevant team"".It would appear the resolution time ""resets"" to default 1-3 days each time the customer makes fresh inquest into his/her case.I then demanded they declare the parcels lost within their tracking system so that a refund + compensation may be initiated to exit me from this trauma and bring about a suitable closure.  The email exchange then went silent, with update from the ninjas pending since my last enquiry via 3 platforms in all - telegram chatbot, telephone call, zendesk email.Today is the last day of pledged delivery window as indicated on Lazada platform and despite my final email check sent out earlier in the day, eerie silence prevails in Ninja quarters...pathetic performance and accountability!My parcels may now be confirmed lost, even though the ninjas are not admitting this utter failure, while keeping me wait in vain.While I shall next pursue  due recourse with Lazada, Ninjavan is highly not recommended for last-mile fulfilment due to gross unreliability and lack of delighting customer accountability just described.",1,"Updated Dec 13, 2021",1,SG,Updated,Dec,12,2021

Lazada,1.5,Bad,My review of Lazada is based on my…,"My review of Lazada is based on my experiences I have had in the last one year. I have ordered all kinds of things from mini tripod to dishwasher. I think one thing I hate the most about the seller's here is that they don't accept change of mind as a valid reason for return. If I have bought a product, especially after paying a fat amount of money, I think I should be able to decide whether I like the product and gonna keep using it. If not, I would rather return it than have a waste lying at my house. Now I understand I might be coming from amazing shopping experiences from websites like Amazon. Unfortunately such shopping experiences not available in Singapore and I have to make do with terrible conditions such as above. There have been times when the seller's have sent me wrong items, crappy items but I just didn't have enough time and energy to keep at returning things. Undoubtedly there have been few good experiences too with Redmart. They have let me process returns when they sent rotten stuff or wrong stuff. Overall my feelings are mixed about Lazada. I would say it's pretty convenient for groceries but not a great place to buy clothes (multiple cases of mismatched size, terrible quality of product), ok to buy some items of medium prices (hit or miss) and totally not ok to buy items were you pay a considerable amount of money because you have no control once you buy the item. You will be forced to keep it even if you don't wanna use it, coz once the money get in the pockets of seller's (almost all) they don't wanna let go of it.",1,11-Sep-19,1,SG,NULL,Sep,9,2019

There was two other legs of the trip that were still confirmed. So I called them to get the other flights sorted out and they cancelled another leg but they couldn't cancel the part that was operated by QATAR airways.They told us that we have to contact eDreams coz the ticket is booked through them and the eDreams was not reachable so the trip for section that was not cancelled was flagged as NO SHOW by PAL.When we asked for refund they insisted that we have to approach eDream and still after 7 month we have not received refund for the section that they marked as NO SHOW. This is obviously their responsibility to coordinate cancellation of all trips when they cancel two legs.Follow up phone calls were all a waste of time as they repeated that we have to approach travel agency.If they wouldn't have flagged part of trip as NO SHOW we could have got full refund when eDreams initiated refund process.No a good customer experience as first time user of the PAL services.Reservation Ref N7XO7U just in case their customer support care about doing the right thing and trying to refund our money.,1,1-Nov-20,6,AU,NULL,Nov,11,2020

Track the item and update me please. I really need the item to be delivered to the address I provided.  I called Lazada on the customer service number last 13th January 2020 hoping to speak to a customer service agent BUT ALL IN VAIN – I was on hold for more than 1 hour and that was an overseas call.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,NO STAR for this company!,"NO STAR for this company!We booked 4 round trip tickets (myself, my son/sister/niece) for July 2020 flight from Canada to Philippines. Due to COVID, the flight was canceled. My sister requested for refund since we used her credit card (and I just paid her back) last June 2020 and was told we have to wait for 6 months. But that never happened and after a series of back and forth emails from them telling lies that it was already in process, we were so frustrated because that cost us more 2,500 CAD each. I saw from one of the travel websites to file a case through Philippine Aeronautics Board. I told my sister about it and after she emailed the board, PAL expedited our refund and we were able to get it last May 2021. However, the tickets for our kids have NOT been refunded so she emailed them again copying the board and was told to wait for 120 days. Guess what?! It didn’t happened and they are saying the same lame excuse and then stop replying to her emails even the board didn’t respond anymore. I file also a complaint at BBB but their reply was that they will follow up with Manila Treasury Board so I rejected their resolution. We are planning to also file complaint through Canada Travel Agency (though it’s a long shot) as we are already desperate to get our hard earned money back. Why are they boasting in their website that 90% have been refunded when so many complaints here?! PAL, be fair to your customers and give back our money!!!

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,UNRELIABLE DELIVERY SERVICE,"Ninja Van in Singapore does not have proper work flow so much so that their delivery man and customer service have different understanding of what ensuring successful parcel delivery mean. I was told about ATL service by one of the delivery person during the COVID period as I had refused to sign off on their machine as it would mean unnecessary contact - he suggested that I opt for ATL and all process is the same except that I will be able to receive items without further physical contact.  Their service of ATL (Authorization to leave) parcel is supposed to be done with ninja notifying when parcel is near before actually leaving the parcel without customer having to sign on their equipment. NOTIFICATION WAS NOT DONE AS PROMISED WHEN DELIVERY WAS NEARING. Upon delivery... there are 2 possibilities: 1) When obviously there was people in the home, the delivery man decided to quietly leave the parcel where it can be stolen and walked away thinking that parcel will ring the door bell to highlight its existence.2) Delivery man did not intend to notify or inform of delivery but set the parcel at front door and took a photo as prove of delivery than stole the parcel and left with it. Anyway parcel was not there when I finally received the delivery completion notification (10 mins later). Immediately contacted customer service about not receiving my delivery, they pushed the blame to the seller and forwarder, taking me for a ride and they finally insists that ATL means: DRIVER UNABLE TO CALL, KNOCK THE DOOR OR RING THE DOORBELL and further added that a message of delivery was sent to inform of delivery between 8am to 10pm.BUSINESS OWNER: If by now you do not see the issue and insist on maintaining that there was nothing wrong with the understanding of what ATL actually means to consumer, maybe you are not fit to handle a delivery business. If you see it, make changes please to better your business. My missing parcel costs usd280 but even if it was usd2.80, a delivery service has the responsibility to ensure they have a sensible/logical workflow instead of having so many loopholes and incompetent internal management who cannot understand a simple statement that you yourself set: “Our Ninja will notify you when your parcel is near and we’ll leave it at your doorstep”.",1,18-Mar-21,1,SG,NULL,Mar,3,2021

We earn $1.5 per parcel and they penalty $100.They will give reasons to customer that they need drivers to learn a lesson and discipline drivers.

The parcel receiver think its one product being delivered from lazada only to find out, after paying to Ninja Van, that its not something ordered and that the package is containing a piece of rock or wood.Money will not be paid back from the motorbike delivery man himself and the  complaint to Ninja Van customer service  takes 3 month with four different personell to investigate only to come back with the explanation that the scammer is willing to pay back the money, if you just contact him on this number that dosent work or on this email that dosent exist. End of investigation.To summarize. Ninja Van is having hundreds of COD complaints and know that the suspicious looking label are a scam when they deliver it. Why?

This is frustrating. Making people wait and wait. This is the 3rd time I have bad experience with Ninja. I do not have issues with other delivery companies which even provide a link so that I can even know the location of the delivery van doing the delivery that day. Ninja messaged at 8am that it will deliver on that day and let the receiver wait the whole day before delivering at 5pm. It does not care how long it makes the receiver wait whereas other competitors will give an indicative time or provide a link for tracking in real time. Ninja should not even be given 1 star.

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,WORST COURIER SERVICE IN SG,"Ninjavan is arguable one of THE WORST courier services I have used in Singapore. Please. Use DHL, JnT, SingPost, just any other courier service other than Ninjavan if you want to receive your parcel safely. Not only is Ninjavan’s delivery procedure ridiculously appalling, they DO NOT GIVE A CRAP ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. Normally, I would not pursue these kinds of matters, I have never bothered to write a review because of a bad experience for any type of service. I would just let it go. But their service is extremely appalling that I even created an account just to write a review because of how infuriated I am. I ordered a bottle of toner that cost $40 on shoppee, and the seller used Ninjavan to send it to me. This happened on Sunday 7/11/20, I was at home the entire day, busy with work. Around 9pm I opened the shoppee application and I realised it said delivery complete. Because there were no knocks on the door, neither was there any sms/call notifications, I assumed the item was sent to the letter box because it was a small bottle of toner. I checked my letter box and I realised I hadn’t received the item and contacted the seller. The seller then sent me an image from ninjavan’s delivery man that the item was already delivered. Prior to this parcel, I had used ninjavan before and I opted for contactless delivery since the items I ordered was small, and as stated by ninjavan, if a customer opts for contactless delivery, delivery verification code is not needed for drivers to drop the parcel at the location provided that it is a SAFE HIDDEN LOCATION. Tell me. Does this look safe nor hidden? As a result of the delivery man leaving it here (I stay on the second floor beside the stairwell where there are many people coming and going all the time), the parcel was stolen. Following this, I talked to Suriya on Ninjavan’s live chat on telegram, and she didn’t help me at all, after explaining to her the problem she simply asked me to email ninjavan and when I requested for help, she left the chat! I was shocked. After which, I emailed ninjavan’s customer service and talked to many other reps, such as Hana, Intan, Adira, whereby these representatives tried to avoid responsibility and even apologised for this “unintentional and rare mistake”. So ninjavan is aware of their mistake in handling the delivery procedure, yet they refuse to refund me and even tries (on multiple attempts) to ask me to ask the seller for a refund. For what? The seller was responsible, sent the goods on time, and even tried to help me with the refund process from ninjavan. Perhaps the only wrong thing the seller ever did was to use ninjavan as her courier service of choice. I even called the customer service number and the lady on the phone asked me to email them to “try my luck” for a refund. IS THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE? I was extremely understanding and nice to all customer service representatives I had talked to. But all of ninjavan’s customer service reps just tried to push the problem to the seller, and asked me to ask her for a refund instead. I refused because this is simply not the seller’s fault? The fault lies within ninjavan’s delivery procedure? Even if I opted for contactless delivery, would it be that hard to knock on the door so I know he had left it outside and I can bring it in? Is it so difficult to place the small bottle of toner in a safe and hidden location such as in between my gate and door? What infuriates me the most is ninjavan’s irresponsibility as a courier service? Ninjavan’s service disgusts me. This is the worst customer service I have ever received in my entire life. They admit they are in the wrong, but they do not refund me for the lost goods, and they try to push the blame to the seller? This is outrageous. Never again will I use Ninjavan as my courier of choice. This was a small mistake because of the deliveryman that caused me to lose a meagre $40, if they had simply apologised right away, not trying to push the blame to me, by saying I am the one who opted for contactless delivery, or to the seller, asking me to ask her for a refund instead when it is clearly not her fault, I would not be as enraged. DISGUSTING SERVICE. And please, please don't reply to this review trying to do service recovery telling me how my feedback is valuable and apologise that I did not have a good experience and to further contact ninjavan so you can better my experience. Because from what I have experience with your service and your many customer service representatives I have spoken to, every single one gave me complete utter nonsense.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Only care about money,"Only care about money. Please don’t fly with this airline if you have health issues (are disabled). We had a flight with Philippines airlines on 5th Feb, But we had to fly early due to health reasons. So on 3rd Feb we had medical emergency so called there head office for help and explained the situation and sent all the medical paperwork via email, so they told us to go to airport ticketing office and they will help us and not charge anything due to medical issue. So we went to airport ticket office and guess what they didn’t want to listen, we showed them all the documentation and explained the whole situation. Told them about what their office told us about not charging us fees but they didn’t care. I talked with the supervisor explaining things again, but they didn’t show any care, only money. So at the end we paid all the fees and extra charges. At the end we paid more than a new ticket. That’s not the end when we went to check in counter we asked if they can upgrade us due to all the hassle and money we paid and she did until she went to ask the supervisor and he said no. And she ripped the boarding passes in front of us. Again, didn’t end there as we boarded we received the worse flight service, my partner was crying most of the flight because of pain and they completely ignore her. I had to break their fun time to get water while they were sitting in premium class chatting and having fun. And to highlight the premier and business class were empty. They didn’t even have 1 passenger and they couldn’t upgrade us it’s a shame. They want to be a 5-star airline, but they don’t have customer service or right attitude for it.

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,Biggest steaming pile of faeces I've ever seen,"Opted for delivery at 24/7 collection point (7-11) with ETA on 25 June. They contacted me and said the collection point is full, asking for an alternative address. I enter my home address and now the ETA became 26 June. When I contacted the customer service through the live chat, they agreed to deliver the parcel on 25 June instead.On the 25th, there is zero notification and my ETA on the tracking page disappears. When I contact them on live chat, they claim the parcel was not delivered due to ""incorrect address"". By that, they meant missing postal code. Guess what, the postal code is the first information needed when I enter the delivery address. So they are either lying to me or the previous agent made the mistake. On top of that, it's ridiculous that the full address with unit number is ""incorrect"" just because of missing postal code. What's worse is that the status changed from  ""Parcel is on its way"" to ""Parcel is being processed at Ninja Van warehouse - Singapore"" within 10 minutes. They clearly did not even attempt to deliver it. I then arrange for delivery on 26 June, which is reflected in the tracking site.Today (26th), I contacted the customer service as there has been no change of status and find out ""the parcel has not reached out warehouse yet"". So if the parcel was never delivered, how can it be that it never reached the warehouse? Afterwards, they confirm that they do not know where the parcel is and cannot give any ETA on the delivery.Absolute garbage service. When you contact the customer service, expect nothing but steaming pile of poop from a customer service ""ninja"" that cannot be bothered to type in proper English (casual short forms, no capitalization, etc).I cannot comprehend why the major retailers will continue to use this horrendous service when clearly, this company's horrible reputation and poor service will rub onto their brand image.

Just runaround.Delivery was promised by August 18.I should have spent a day and walked to city and back with a car battery. We are all supposed to avoid going into cities and mingling with people.

Sendflowerstophilippines,4.2,Great,is this a fraudulent company? MAYBE not at all..-- but a horrible experience? yes.,"Ordered flowers and chocolates for my mom's birthday last Sunday, which is 5 days ahead of the supposedly delivery date, and I specifically wrote what time it's supposed to be delivered (before 10am) since I know my family are going out and that's the only time someone is actually there to receive the flowers. ( They do give you that option as to what time you want it be delivered). Tried contacting the number listed on their website (sensitive information) (this number is listed in Los Angeles, CA), it rings two times and then says that the person your calling is unavailable ,please leave your message.By the way, this is the same number (sensitive information) that is listed on this website(external reference) .  ----I am updating this review because I am a good netizen. So the flowers with the chocolates did came after all..Late though..but as what they say, better late than never. It arrived very late (4pm). If that is acceptable to you then yes it is fine, but for me it is not. If you gave me that option as to what time I need the flowers to be delivered, I expect nothing less but a prompt service.Now, if you cannot do that, then why would you ask me for a specific time then? That is very misleading. (don't you think?) What made my experience with this website a horrible one (and that's why am giving them a one star) is that they did not meet the expectations regarding the time it was supposed to be delivered and the fact that they are very hard if not impossible to get hold of. ( Oh, they did message me at 2 am..that's like 5 hours late..) Of course it is still up to you people to order from this website.But for me? I will not do it again.",1,"Updated Aug 8, 2014",4,US,Updated,Aug,8,2014

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,PAL has downgraded my return flight without notice,"PAL has downgraded my return flight from prem eco to eco without any written notice. I only found out because I couldn't retrieve my booking online. Since it has been downgraded and my ticket says rebooking allowed without fee,  I have rang the manila office as the Sydney office wasn't very helpful. I asked the Manila office to change the date of the return flight 3 times and had to repeat my request 3 times and spent an hour on overseas calls as the staff asks me to stay on the line for verification. One staff wanted to charge me penalty fees and agreed to change without penalty fees only after pointing out the conditions of my ticket but up to now has not sent a confirmation email. I find it appalling that after PAL has downgraded me, I am told that I may not be entitled to the voucher refund of USD $100 because I am changing the date and that I am entitled to a refund only if I stick to the original date.

I booked a round trip flight from Hawaii to Manila and made the first leg of my trip without a hitch. Months later, I contracted covid-19 and didn't think I'd make my return flight so decided to rebook and called to make my request. I was advised to request the rebooking via MyPAL Request hub, which was almost impossible to find on the website, but I did. Days before the originally scheduled flight, I still had not heard from PAL regarding the rebooking so decided to call to followup. I was advised that in order to followup regarding the rebooking, I would have to use MyPAL Request Hub for the followup. The process is just a form that is not even able to retrieve the original request that is inputted and it makes you feel that your request is going to a blackhole. The day of the flight, I still had not heard from them. Needless to say, do not be fooled by the unlimited rebooking benefit that they supposedly provide when you purchase a ticket. Sure they offer it, but best of luck on actually trying to rebook a flight because you may end up kissing your fare goodbye.",1,3-Sep-21,1,US,NULL,Sep,9,2021

Since then, nobody from pldt bothers to inform thru text, call or email about my request only to find out on August 13 using their messenger live chat that I have to submit a notarized contract of lease because my new address is blacklisted maybe from a previous subscriber. The owner of the address is out of town so I have to wait for them to arrive. August 26, I emailed them the copy of notarized contract of lease and on August 30 I received a text from pldt stating that there is no service order request for my relocation and I have email them with a letter of request with valid ID. I did comply. After a while, I received a text from them that I have to pay 1159.00 for them to activate my fiber internet service. Really?

So many years in business yet they still have no clue what theyre doing. All they do well is Apologize and tell you lies. They made over 3 billion US dollars in revenue in 2019 yet they dont hire staff with any brains and they dont train their staff either.

How can they get away with it? Because the government dont do anything about it. PLDT probably pay them off.

The wifi may have it's good moments, but I believe that these good moments shouldn't even be counted as moments. I can accept a slow internet speed, but an inconsistently average to slow one is much more infuriating to deal with, and PLDT takes the cake for it. Here's the pattern that tends to happen, 1. The wifi is okay, it consistently functions like normal, and will slow down if too much work is applied to it.2. The wifi stops and gets cut out for some reason, and pldt would have to fix it.3. The wifi gets fixed, but it's not as it used to be, it feels damaged and unstable in connections. Sometimes only google, youtube and other generic must have sites are accessible, but not everything else. Sometimes you're connected, but there isn't any internet. The speed goes around the range of 1mbps to 200kbps, even just 10kbps.  More problems arise overtime.I am sure that its on PLDT, as when i use my celluar data on my area, it seems to be almost perfect for gaming. PLDT's speed is only half of what my data has given me, and its not even consistent.

SELLER: BINLU.PHMY REASON FOR REQUEST RETURN/REFUND:“ITEM DOESN’T MATCH DESCRIPTION/PICTURES”. I WANTED GARDEN LIGHTS, BUT THE DELIVERED PACKAGE SAYS “FOR INDOOR USE ONLY” ON THE BOX! IT SHOULD SAY “INDOOR/OUTDOOR” AT LEAST. THEY EVEN POSTED A PHOTO OF A TREE COVERED WITH CHRISTMAS LIGHTS! THE SELLER LEFT THAT INFORMATION OUT WHEN SELLING ONLINE. IRRESPONSIBLE. EVERYBODY KNOWS INDOOR LIGHTS IS NOT SAFE FOR OUTDOOR USE. SELLER CLAIMS IT IS FOR OUTDOOR. SO THE PACKAGE IS WRONG? THAT’S WORSE. THE PACKAGE SAYS “FOR INDOOR USE ONLY.”AS FAR AS I KNOW, I HAVE 7 DAYS TO RETURN/REFUND THE ITEM. I RECEIVED THE ITEM ON OCT 28. I DETECTED THE PROBLEM THE NEXT DAY. LAZADA NEVER EXPLAINED THAT YOU SHOULD CONTACT WITH THE SELLER DIRECTLY. SO SINCE IT WAS HUNDAS BREAK (ALLHALLOWTIDE), I FILED TO LAZADA FOR A RETURN/REFUND OF THE ITEM ON THE 6th DAY. THEY TOLD ME TO CHAT AND SEND A MESSAGE WITH THE SELLER. I DID SEND MY CONCERN WITH THE SELLER AND AGREED TO MY RETURNING THE ITEMS. A FEW MINUTES LATER I RECEIVED A REPLY FROM THE SELLER, THEY “RETURN REJECTED” ME WHEN I REQUESTED FOR RETURN/REFUND. THEN I CALLED LAZADA FOR THE SECOND TIME AND THEY TOLD ME TO CALL THE SELLER DIRECTLY. LAZADA GAVE ME THE SELLER’S NUMBER. I TOLD LAZADA THAT THE SELLER AGREED TO MY REQUEST FOR A RETURN/REFUND. THEY EVEN ASKED FOR SOME PICTURES OF THE ITEMS. I CALLED THE SELLER AND THEY ANSWERED. THEY ASKED ME REGARDING MY CONCERNS BUT WHEN I EXPLAINED IT TO THEM, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY “RECEIVED SOMEONE  FROM ANOTHER LINE” AND MADE ME END THE CALL. THAT DAY WAS THE LAST DAY OF MY SEVEN DAYS.THEY KEPT REJECTING UNTIL THE DEADLINE TO RETURN LAPSED.THEN I CHAT THE SELLER AGAIN. THEN LATER I AGREED THAT I SHOULD RETURN THE ITEM. I ASKED ABOUT MY REFUND. THEY CANNOT REFUND MY MONEY BECAUSE ALL THE ITEMS ARE FUNCTIONING! I TOLD THEM HOW ABOUT MY REFUND OF THE ITEMS, THEY ANSWERED THEY CAN’T DO REFUNDS BUT THEY WOULD WANT ME TO RETURN THE ITEMS TO THEM. THEN I CALLED AGAIN LAZADA FOR THE THIRD TIME. A GIRL ANSWERED. I ASKED HER IF THEY COULD JUST REFUND MY ITEM . I’M WILLING TO RETURN IT TO LAZADA AND HELP ME WITH MY REFUND. BUT ACCORDING  TO LAZADA, ALL ITEMS WILL BE RETURNED TO THE SELLER, BUT MY REFUND WILL BE ACCORDING TO THE DECISION OF THE SELLER. SHE EVEN TOLD ME THAT THERE IS AN ICON THAT LEADS ME TO THE PAGE WHERE I CAN PRESENT MY CASE OR CONCERNS. I TOLD HER I CAN’T FIND IT BUT I ALREADY CLICKED THE RETURN/REFUND REQUEST. THEN THE GIRL FROM LAZADA ASKED ME IF I STILL HAVE CONCERNS BUT WHEN I WAS GOING TO EXPLAIN MY SITUATION, SHE IMMEDIATELY HUNG UP ON ME. WHERE IS “CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT”?!

Entrego,1.4,Bad,Package 0031-700001501009,"Package 0031-700001501009Sir’s, I do not know how to express my feeling towards your lamentable service, service being a misnomer, twice packages have been dispatched to my Baguio address from Lazada via your company with the same result both times, the parcel was undelivered and returned to sender.Not through any fault of ours, the address and contact information is correct we receive at least one parcel a week by other couriers with no problems and due to current Covid-19 restrictions I am always at home. No, it is because your system allows a package to be sent out for delivery, taken on a site-seeing tour of Baguio and flagged an attempted delivery, when the tracking information on your sites states “An attempt was made to deliver your package. Reason: No delivery attempt on route.” How in the name of reason is that a fault of ours or a failed attempt at delivery?  Then on the 24th June came the best one yet, as your delivery person called for directions which were provided, then disappeared for 45 minutes when only six minutes travel away, after the third time of calling he answered and by which time the heavens had opened and we were having a violent storm, I asked if he was lost and he asked if he could deliver the package on the following day due to the conditions to which I agreed. Only to find out when again the items did not arrive that the parcel was listed again as a failed delivery, the reason given “Customer changed date” I was flabbergasted!Whenever you return my package to sender it costs me no small amount of money, this is unfair and unreasonable when it is no fault of ours. I wish that there was a way of selecting the courier by whom my purchases were to be delivered on the Lazada website but unfortunately there is not, if it were the case your company would never feature in my selection I can only assure you that when I send items from here which is often, I will never use your diabolical company.",1,30-Jun-20,1,PH,NULL,Jun,6,2020

Next day (28 Oct) it said it was out for delivery and will be delivered by 10pm on 28 Oct. Called them to ask them about the parcel and told them that we received no calls despite them saying that we requested for a change in delivery date/time. They said they will “escalate the matter and look into it closely”. But surprise surprise, delivery unsuccessful again! Checked again today (29 Oct) and it said the parcel is being sent back to the sender. Called them and they said it’s because of 3 failed delivery attempts. Told them it’s not my fault, I never received any calls but they claim that their driver has proof, so we’ll see if the proof is legit. They can deliver from 9am-10pm for 3 days but still unsuccessful delivery?  Something definitely went wrong somewhere. I received no calls about delivery attempts, but yet driver claims to have proof of calls? I’m starting to wonder if the driver even attempted to deliver the item.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,"Re-scheduled flight, no alternative provided, dreadful customer service experience","Philippine Airlines unilaterally re-scheduled my return flight, anticipating it by 5 hours. Apparently this is commonplace with the flights to/from Manila, and, as you can imagine, it caused a lot of trouble to me (I was told to take an 8am flight instead of a 1:30pm flight, which, given I was not in Manila the night before, causes a lot of problems to me).When I called the customer service center to see if I could be allocated to a different flight, I was first told to call back in a few days, as this was being reviewed by the company. When I called back, no record of the call was with Philippine Airlines, and I was bluntly told that this was not the airline responsibility (they did unilaterally changed the departure time, so not sure why it is not their responsibility?). I was offered no alternative, and the call center representative dropped the call (I could not even file a complaint).I would also flag the really bad way I was treated during the phone calls, as I was bounced back and forth across different customer service centers. Finally, I am an English speaker, and I really struggled with the call center level of spoken english (I could barely make out what they said, and had to spell numerous times the reservation code).In a nutshell: if you book with this airline, good luck with their customer service, it's even worse than the one you would find in London!!!!

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Horrendous customer service & treatment of a person with a disability -- avoid!,"Philippine Airlines' horrendous customer service and attitude to a person with a disability (myself) was, frankly, appalling, and I strongly suggest you do not fly with them. Their customer service flat-out misled me *twice* prior to flying, and their incompetence cost me my mobility device which resulted in financial cost, physical pain, and a great deal of stress. Their customer service cannot be trusted, they do not respond, and they evidently just don't care.Here's what happened. I use a walking stick, and when travelling I take an electric kick scooter to use as a mobility device as I can't walk very far without serious consequences. I've travelled with my scooter (as a mobility device) for years as checked luggage, both domestically and internationally, always after obtaining prior airline approval. In January I was relocating to Japan, and we wanted to fly PAL on the one-way trip. I called and asked if it was possible to take my electric kick scooter as a mobility device. They said yes, just book the flight and call back so we can make a note on your booking. I booked the flight, called back, and they said no, you cannot fly with the scooter because it's not a mobility device. This was a shock, and I said I understand in general, but surely you have a dangerous goods department that handles these sorts of enquiries for passengers with a disability (as other airlines do). They eventually said if you get approval from your doctor (which I always do) & submit requested documentation, we will assess it. I provided everything that was asked, the airline's doctor signed off on it, and I was told, in writing, that I was approved to fly with the device. Great!That was until it came time to check in. At the terminal, as I'm preparing to leave my country permanently, they said you cannot fly with your mobility device, the PAL doctor's approval doesn't count, and they don't know why the customer service rep said I was approved to fly with it... even though I had it all in writing. No matter what I said -- or the fact I've flown domestically and internationally with the device many times for years -- they refused to budge.This was extremely distressing as I was forced to forfeit my (expensive!) mobility device and then suffer at my destination without it, as I only had my walking stick & no ability to get a new mobility device. I followed up the airline twice at numerous addresses, including the ironically named ""We care"" email address, and heard absolutely nothing back.This is shameful behaviour and I hate to think how they treat others with disabilities more severe than mine. Both customer service reps misled me before the flight, and the lack of any response afterwards just rubbed salt in the wound. I ask you to please consider flying with literally any other airline.",1,17-Feb-20,1,JP,NULL,Feb,2,2020

Could not buy duty free at LHR because got some bizarre reason, you have to clear immigration and customs in Manila (which means getting your bags and then dropping them off again), then transfer to a designated domestic flight, which means 100ml security liquids limit or putting your 1 litres bottles of duty free booze into your hold luggage; yeh, right!Most uncomfortable long haul seat ever; BAD. Lunch trays do not fit the fold down tables; had to try to cut whole chicken breast with plastic knife while trying to prevent the tray from flying off the table. Horrible food too. Absolutely the worst long haul flight I have ever had. Then, they rescheduled the ""connecting"" Cebu flight which also turned up late; 5.5 hours in Manila Airport. Late meeting my girlfriend who flew in earlier from Legazpy.NEVER, EVER AGAINCompensation Philippine Airlines now please.Return flight even worse; Philippine Airlines cancelled my Cebu to Manila flight and stuck me on an earlier flight. This caused major problem as my girlfriend and I were on similar departure time flights (she on Cebu Pacific to Legazpy) so we could both have breakfast at the hotel (which I prepaid), allow me to check us both out (as the card holder and person that booked the hotel) and take the same taxi to the airport, so I could make sure all was well with her.Under IATA / Montreal Cancellation rules, I had the right to demand a suitable flight with another carrier, which Philippine Airlines refused to do. I would have to buy another ticket with someone else they said and then see if I could claim from them! Trouble is, the alternatives were all last minute expensive. Philippine Airlines even refused to upgrade my ticket as compensation. So, we had to change my girlfriend's Cebu Pacific flight to the day before, which last minute act cost me more than the original ticket price. Bottom line, I get to spend one less day and night with her, her holiday with me was cut short, I will have to go to bed really early and get up to leave the hotel at 3AM. I will then have a 5.5 hour wait at Manila Airport.I want compensation as per my legal right. I also want to complain about the conduct of their customer service managers at Cebu and Manila that refused my legal right to an alternative. They tried every excuse in the book not to help me including the coronavirus was affecting their scheduling (cancelled flight to China do not affect internal flights and those to the UK; you should kiss my feet for using your rancid airline while other Brits stay away from Asia, not treat me like some schmuck).

PawnHero & Marketplace,4.2,Great,Horrible service! PawnZero!,"Please avoid transacting with PAWNHERO! The company has hidden terms that they don't display on their website. I tried to use their services, and at first the system looks really easy to use. Their estimate system provided with an estimate of my items, which is by the way really undervalued. The price estimate didn't even reach 25% of the items I'm pawning! Now I asked the, through customer service how much they will pay in case the item is lost, and guess what, they will inly pay up till the loaned amount! So doubling the amount loaned to you won't even be 50% of the item value. What bad insurance! Now since I needed the money, I had to use the service. So I pawned another item. They valued the item, the pickup was booked, and I got a confirmation, A CONFIRMATION, of the pickup date. Morning of the pickup date I received another cinfirmation that they won't be able to provide a pickup time. Then around 11 am, I receive a text, they will not proceed with the pickup if my items won't go over P15,000! Not anywhere on the website, or on the estimate is this mentioned! Also they already gave a confirmation of the pickup! I received a phone call confirming this, I explained to the rep how this is false advertisement, and asked for a supervisor. Guess what the rep did, they said I'll be forwarded to customer support, and then he hung up! I am also holding on to an email from them stating the same thing, which is forcing me to look for items to pawn to increase the value to P15,000. On the email it says they do this due to high volume demands, I say they do this to squeeze items from people who look like they have a lot of high profit items! Otherwise this would've been on their website and estimate system, and a confirmation shouldn't have even been given! This is a long rant, point is, avoid PAWNHERO! Companies like this should close down!Wow the nerve of this company to reply to me that ""You only had a limit due to high demand volume!"" Hey Pawnzero, just to let you know, companies should not and should never change their system just because you have ""High demand volume!"" And just to let everyone know, this company already gave a CONFIRMATION of the pickup when they mentioned there was a change in terms! Pawnzero if everyone did what you just did then anyone can abuse this and cough up more frim their customers! Your system provided an estimate, you provided a CONFIRMATION OF PICKUP! You can not trust a company like this who doesn't follow their own terms and their own system. And just to let you know, their customer service is rude, hung up on me twice! And to note that they are the one who called me! And don't tell me that they have a reason to do it, I work in a customer service oriented environment, and I know what not to do in a call! Your customer service just is not interested in customer experience! My advice to everyone reading this, read the terms when transacting online and know the consumer laws of the Philippines. Companies like this Pawnhero like to take advantage of the unaware. I'm already coordinating with the authorities and am currently mounting a campaign against this company.

At least they asked for my PayPal details for the refund. Unfortunately the story does even end there. On the supposed day of delivery, a driver still called saying he was about to deliver my order. There was absolutely no coordination between their customer service and Cebu branch. After 11 days of waiting for the refund, I messaged them again but they said my refund request was overlooked by the refund team. Flowerstore.Ph “forgot” to add my name to their refund list.

We got a bill online saying we need pay 1299 but apparently the bill is 1750 and now they blocked our wifi because I refused paying before everything was working.  Secondly when the sales person came to our address she said 1299 ph pr months nothing else but now pldt statement is we need pay 1750 pr month in 3 years because we need pay for phone and ect. The sales person never informed about that she said only 1299 pr month.

They are so fast to close account but it don't work the other way. Sadly you can't call them because you need sit hours and hours pushing numbers trying find the right way to a real person.

Shopee,1.8,Poor,Just Promises But No Action,"Problem: Received the product but different from what the seller advertised. Deceptive seller. Action: I contacted Shopee about it many times and they assured me that I'd soon have an update regarding my complaint.Update: NO UPDATE ever given. So I contacted customer service again and they assured me that I'd get an update WITHIN THE DAY but that's just again a promise. From the time I filed, almost one month waiting if seller's reprimanded or not. For me, I just need to make sure that the seller won't have other victims. But I guess Shopee is not on the same page.I'm almost ready to let it go, but then I encountered another problem, the last product I ordered from Shopee failed to arrive (even with extended Shopee guarantee). So I dealt with this again for my refund (let's see if they could give refund within 24 hours as promised or promises again?). With this, I was reminded of my second complaint. By the way, my first complaint was also a product that came after almost a month (July 23) even though the seller shipped it immediately (July 6) and take note, it's only from Manila. Okay going back to my second complaint about the deceptive seller. I retold it four times today (August 8, 2021) to different agents since their server kept getting ""error"". Once you're disconnected, it seems no record from their side so you have to tell over again and again. It's frustrating and inconvenient. For the last agent, she asked me about the case number? Seriously, case number? I filed the complaint directly on the system, and there's no update indicating of a case number. So I don't know what the agent was talking about. And then our conversation was cut because of ""server error"" again. This would be the last time for me to follow up this since Shopee obviously can't do its job. The best assurance I have, we have God who gives justice to different kinds of cheating. Sooner or later, the deceptive seller would have a dose of his own medicine. Guaranteed. TIPS FOR ONLINE BUYERS 1. Check first if Lazada has the items you wish to buy. Out of all the products I've ordered from Lazada (150+ products), so far no problems encountered so I've never experienced contacting their customer service. For Shopee, many times. And take note that's out of 39 products only, so would this mean that if I ordered more, the probability of complaining a product would be higher? Most likely. 2. Once you contact Shopee's customer service, save a screenshot as proof of their promises/responses. 3. When you file a complaint, better have one report that you save first on your phone/laptop coz it seems Shopee doesn't have a record of complaints. At least you'd just copy paste every time you do follow up and deal with another, clueless agent asking same questions and giving same answers. 4. Be proactive in sharing feedback and reviews to stop deceptive sellers. Always check your orders upside down before clicking ""received order"" - this is to protect you as a buyer (one of Shopee's good features, take advantage of it) and for you to at least get a refund if encountered a problem. Remember, once the money is released, it's as good as you'll never see that money again. 5. You can also check physical stores FIRST for the items needed. Calculate the price difference between physical and online stores. Take note, when you buy online, you're paying the shipping fee. So the total price (actual product + shipping) is almost the same as the physical stores. At least for physical stores, you're able to see the product before buying and can easily go back to that store if defective.  6. Every penny you spend matters. They're you're hard-earned money that you don't want others to just take advantage of (especially deceptive sellers). So doing some comparisons will save you from headache: Lazada VS ShopeeOnline Stores VS Physical Stores Impulsive Buying VS Saving More TO CUSTOMERS Let's help each other in making wise decisions and by being proactive giving tips and reminders. TO SHOPEE Please improve your customer service. It's not all about money-money!!! Every customer counts. Every complaint deserves an update and not just promises. If you don't want your customer service to be always contacted, then make sure that all your processes are superb. And please make records that if an order ID has a filed complaint, just clicking that order should show it. Imagine your customers retelling same complaints to different agents available. Such an inconvenience!And please improve your shipping. I know you have a new system for it but seriously even local products get to their destination for almost a month. Unbelievable!  Of course, I would hold on to my Shopee account not because of Shopee but because of some favorite stores I've bought from with incredible products. Shopee you just need to improve!",1,8-Aug-21,1,PH,NULL,Aug,8,2021

Lazada,1.5,Bad,WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"REFERENCE NUMBER: 2050000005898494Let me be this a warning to all. This is my way of venting my frustration, As there is no other platform to do so. Lazada deliberately treats my concern with them as joke. I ordered a pair of motorcycle goggles, from a foreign seller in China. When the goggles arrived, it had a lot of scratches but it was bearable to use. I gave it a 3 star review. after 2 months the seller noticed my review, and contacted me directly through Lazada chat and confirmed the issue, and he was really polite and apologetic with  the product that I received. He offered to ship a brand new product, by giving a voucher for 999 pesos, as the goggles was priced at 998. Being excited, and thankful, I immediately tried to reorder, but for some reason, that Voucher could not be accepted in the Check out page. It was not usable, but it was clearly on my system. The seller, sent it out twice but to no avail, seeing that this was not the seller's fault, i contacted the customer live chat. First rep, asked me details, I sent out screenshots, he/she promised 2 weeks that they'll give me an update. after those 2 weeks, i contacted again, 2nd rep acted as if she this was the first time the case was opened,  i explained again, gave out information again, she promised me I would be getting an update. after waiting again for a week so, i contacted again for the 3rd time because i still didnt receive an update, but those transcripts they kept sending me, and the emails, that keep telling me to provide more information that I already gave! The 3rd rep, that talked me only told me that they can only give me 100 worth instead of the whole 999, and ofcourse I was outraged, then she promised me that they would update and escalate this to their ""other department"". Again, for the nth time for not receiving anything or contacting them, i contacted them and the 4th rep, told me that THE CASE WAS CLOSED. naturally being human, I got mad said a few bad words, and this rep only warns me to not use profane words, and the only thing he could say, is that he could only escalate this to the department again. ofcourse outraged again,  I didn't reply for awhile to cool down, but after not getting a response from me, he immediately terminated the chat. This is beyond frustrating, and I don't want to be the one who rants in the internet, but seriously this is the worst customer service I've ever encountered.",1,15-Oct-19,1,PH,NULL,Oct,10,2019

This is the 5th day and still they have told me to wait 24hrs for the payment confirmation, what a nightmare!its now 13th of October 2020SHOPEE cannot find the solution!!! Whats the use of the complaint reference number when what they do is just sent you an email, answer it saying they are doing there best to find the solution and ask me again for the details. Then another employee of SHOPEE will email me again the next day and say that they havn't heard anything from me and will take the issue as ""solved"" within 24hrs if no reply from me. This is happening everyday since I complaint,13 days now and counting......I dont understand they should see the  Complaint email History and see all the details or maybe what SHOPEE is doing is let the customer get tired of complaining so the money will just be with their account, i wonder how many of us have not given their money back?????",1,"Updated Oct 13, 2020",2,AE,Updated,Oct,10,2020

Lazada,1.5,Bad,Records will show that I have been a…,"Records will show that I have been a frequent buyer of Lazada products. Nearly every week I have placed orders with Lazada. As of today I will no longer be doing business with Lazada. I requested to return an item, a moon lamp, costing 388p. If you look at the misleading add video on your site you will see they made the lamp look the size of a basketball in comparison to the hand tapping it. When I recieved it the size is that of a tennis ball.  I was in the process of ordering an Acer laptop computer priced over 28000 p at the time I recieved your denial email.  You can see from my Lazada Cart on your site I had saved this computer to place the order. I will not be ordering a computer from Lazada or doing any further business with Lazada in the future. Not a good business decision for Lazada. You are refusing a return request of 388p product at a cost of many time over that in future sales. Look in your records how long I have done business with Lazada and how much I have ordered. I will be getting word out to as many online product review sites that I can find. I will be sharing of my poor experience with Lazada's customer services with all of my family and friends.

Receiving only something like chocolate love but with only 10pieces of ferrero rocher and with some kind of dead-like flowers. No one's answering my call in their smart phone number. Even with messenger, only to end up getting seened the exact time I message them, Everytime! Why are you like this? How are you going to resolve this?Edit: They were able to deliver my 2 order at Feb 15 and making the wrong item I received at Feb 14, free of charge. Both 2 items I received compared from Feb 14 item were in good shape and looks pretty much high quality! They even gave free chocolate bar that I think is dairy milk chocolate bar.

PLDT,1.1,Bad,MY BILL SHOULD BE ZERO,"So I got stranded in Mindanao when this Covid 19 pandemic hit the world, middle of March. My PLDT subscription is in Cebu, and I was only able to get back in the city last October 28. 1. When I was in Mindanao, I called them THREE times regarding my situation. I had asked them to hold or cut my subscription so I won't get billed in something I won't be able to use in this pandemic. I only received statements of bills to pay in my email, I didn't get any calls from management or from the business office. NONE.2. On my third call, the agent from the 171 number, told me that they can actually check and see my usage if i was really telling the truth. So I was confident that they would be able to help since my phone and internet where UNPLUGGED since middle of March when I left for Mindanao. (FYI: i paid my march and april bills) She also told me that my first TWO calls where useless because the agents didn't forward my ticket/problem to their superiors/business office.3. Waited for calls. Nothing. Checked my email and only got another statement of my supposedly ""bills"". My request for ZERO bill was denied with no reason at all.4. Went to their PLDT Jones office 11/12/2020 and the teller made me write a letter stating that I wasn't here in the city for almost 8 months so I wasn't able to use my phone and internet. I was then told to put it in their DROP BOX and to wait for a CALL in 2-5 days. W-T-F. The process is CHEAP and embarassing. There should be a BETTER and faster way to solve this. They have ALL the tools and ways to let their customers know about their bills but they won't help us with our PROBLEMS?They have the computers in front of their faces and they can see my account. They should have given me ZERO balance right there in the office.5. We, my family and I, have been a subscriber since the 90's. I will cut all our subscription if I, a loyal customer, don't get what I think I deserve.- the 1st two call agents should be fired for lying and misleading a customer",1,12-Nov-20,1,PH,NULL,Nov,11,2020

They scheduled it on a specific day (For example Monday). I have waited until Monday but never came. This happened before COVID-19 arrived to Philippines. Oh and for the lucky asses Fiber users, you are lucky enough the community prioritises you all instead of others. I would rate their customer service as a 1 star. I would say PLDT can only be really great with richest people because of Fiber of course. Remember, never choose PLDT. Just rely on mobile data until they fix their ""excused"" problems. Oh yeah.

When I play Online Games, the internet is too slow that it mostly cuts me off since the wifi is too slow. I have complained to the company and made them fix the router and it fixed as what the PLDT technician said so I used it for a day and it did not change. I had a friend who used to work in PLDT, lets call him A. So A went to the site where is checks my own data base about my own wifi, the only thing it said was the wifi was reseted. Thats all. Nothing fixed. The things which only changed was the password. So I called them to fix the router again but nothing. They did exactly the same thing but with a different reason. They said that my Ethernet Cable was rusting so I bought a new one and used it again but my wifi was still 500kbps. I do not recommend this company. This is the worst wifi company I have cointracted with comparing with all the wifi companies I have contracted with.

I highly recommend that you (first) make sure that you are buying form a legit seller as some are bogus and are scammers with you ending up receiving a rock on your package. (second) Make sure to check for reviews. If the reviews are bad then DO NOT BUY! another thing is to make sure the reviews are not fabricated, you know what i mean. (third and probably the most important one) ALWAYS DO COD or cash on delivery, then open the package upon receipt and make sure you get what you ordered. so far with these 3 tips i always ended up with great products. Good luck and happy online shopping.",4,30-May-19,2,PH,NULL,May,5,2019
PLDT,1.1,Bad,TOTAL GARBAGE,"So far, PLDT is the worst telco I've come across. I applied for an installation online. It's been a month now and nothing happened; no one came. I keep on contacting them on Twitter, Messenger and email and I seldom get a response. Since I was getting really frustrated, I headed to their office at Antipolo, near Shopwise, hoping I would finally get a solution. But it was just a waste of gas and time.Their customer service is clearly not trained to handle customers' problems and didn't even apologize for the inconvenience they have caused. It was as if I should even be thankful that she looked up my problem on her computer. I'm so sick and tired of their garbage service I don't know what to do anymore. She just told me to wait and wait and that's it. Don't they know that they get their salaries from the customers they treat like trash??The only reason I'm still sticking with PLDT is because I don't have any choice. Globe's line is far from home, while Converge and SkyCable isn't available in our area yet. Can't wait to dump PLDT for the new telco. I hope they would close their business already because they're not really helping the country improve. They're just a massive headache without cure.",1,Updated 31 Oct 2018,1,PH,Updated,Oct,10,2018

Wednesday, Ninja CLAIMS they came to my factory office at 2333h!! Who on earth would be in the office close to MIDNIGHT? Thursday, nothing! On Friday, I cancel order through Amazon at 1000h, Ninja mysteriously appear at 1215h!And how to contact Ninja? Not SMS, email or phone call! But by Viber and other unpopular platforms many people have not heard of, especially older people. The Ninja delivery person had no caller ID, and called only on arrival, just before l was almost about to leave for lunch. Just a 15 minute courtesy call before arrival would have sufficed. I refused to accept the delivery on principle, although I needed the item quite urgently, and I now have to take the trouble to buy it at a bricks and mortar shop, which is more expensive and time consuming.Amazon, you should rethink your tie up with Ninja, you’re losing a lot of business because of them..",1,20-Nov-21,3,SG,NULL,Nov,11,2021

Called the costumer service and was informed of an unknown address issue on my order (which is unacceptable because I just recently had a successful order and delivery to the same address).

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,PAL is not my pal.,"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! I thought Air China was horrible, after dealing with PAL’s customer service I will never fly through them again. My flight through Lion Air from Surabaya to Jakarta was delayed (Lion Air’s fault) causing me to miss my connecting flight to Manila (via Philippines Air). When I got to the customer desk at CGK the staff was absolutely useless. Instead of showing empathy over my obvious distress, the only solution they offered me was to book me for a flight 12 hours later (it was 1 AM when I got to the desk) and charge me over IDR 2.2 million in penalty fees. After explaining my situation, the customer service agent kept cutting me off and saying “there’s nothing we can do”. So I’m now stuck in an airport with no hotel or amenities and have to wait 12 hours to catch my next flight and I’m out $160 USD.  I messaged PAL on Facebook and it was the same experience. They continuously repeated themselves saying to go to Lion Air for compensation. I worked in customer service for several years and if you truly wanted to help the customer, you could. They obviously did not want to help me so as a result I do not recommend them nor will I ever fly PAL again.",1,1-Dec-17,3,US,NULL,Dec,12,2017

Called in the afternoon again if parcel will be arriving soon as I've not received any notifications yet and the webinar will be starting at 7pm. The second agent confirmed again that the delivery will be made and will inform driver of the urgency. In the evening when I called again they simply said sorry the parcel will not be delivered today and actually they have 3 days to make the delivery. Then why didn't they say this in the first place and promised the delivery??? I could have gone and borrowed a laptop from someone else instead of waiting the whole day for their delivery.What makes me more frustrated is that I offered to drop by for self collection or pay for lalamove to collect the parcel and they said I cannot do that. Also they promised someone will get back to me to see if they can arrange something but nobody even called back.The money I paid for the 3 days weekend webinar is lost as I will not be able to accomplish any of the hands-on tasks to complete the program.

Shopee,1.8,Poor,Disgusting,"The company itself is a scammer, what with their misleading promotions on ""fReE sHipPiNg nO MiN sPeNd"" or the big joke that is their coins cashback vouchers. Graying out the vouchers when you go to checkout at the exact moment they become available, or worse, running out THE EXACT SECOND they ""become available""--is it even humanly possible to claim these vouchers within 0.1 seconds? This platform is shady as hell. And the honest sellers get caught up in it, because Shopee can't be bothered to do quality and background checks on sellers and products. They let the scammers get away with selling counterfeit products and put it all on you for making the purchase, even when there isn't always a way to check their authenticity. It's ridiculous, because if they were doing their job we shouldn't have to worry about these things. Their customer support is beyond useless, and often come off as half-wits who don't even know how to form coherent sentences because they themselves don't know what the hell they're talking about. They will give you the runaround and they won't even bother trying to hide it. They are incompetent, and most likely don't even get paid minimum wage and just signed up for the job because some recruiter pulled them from the streets. Absolutely abhorrent.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,The flight Stated in Bacolod City…,"The flight Stated in Bacolod City Negros Occidental Philippines.My wife and I boarded what they call a sweeper flight because of Covi19.The plane was very late and was fully packed and the atmosphere was tense and understandably so because of the situation and  reminds me of a bad movie. The flight attendants were so poorly trained and this did not help the situation. The front pocket of my seat was full of used tissue - a very dangerous thing under this circumstances. It appears that the plane was not cleaned prior to our boarding based on how dirty the washroom were. When we arrive in Manila there was Chaos in their shuttle bus, no one was in charge - no social distancing from plane and shuttle service; we all are shoulder to shoulder.When we finally boarded the plane to Los Angeles (late of course) and it was also packed that I prayed I hope I do not catch the virus here. Again the plain did not appear clean as I observed the galley and the washrooms. Very minimal (bad food) was served and forget about asking the attendants for help = they are usually sitting down at the rear of the plane.The washrooms were never cleaned during the duration of the flight so I leave that smell to your imagination. In my years of flying this is the first time I would like to kiss the grounds at LAX and just go home.

All support staff were extremely kind and helpful, but the company policy and certain delivery staff are simply horrendous. Missing package due to poor handling and technical issue, but there was nothing ninjavan could do about it.7 Apr 8AM:Ninjabot notifies me that parcel will be delivered on that day. Asks me to decide if I want the package to be delivered contactless. I select 'NOT contactless' since package theft is common in my area.7 Apr ~3PM:Delivery driver leaves package at the gate of my house, 1) In full view of the public and easily reachable by anyone walking by. 2) Left it despite my setting of 'NON contactless' delivery.Package was NOT there when I contacted my family members to check after I received the 'delivered' notification.8-13 Apr:I contacted ninjavan support staff for help on this issue. Long story but this was their exact reply:'After the investigation with my relevant team, we have check properly that there is a technical issue from our end(ninja  van) as it is not reflected in our system after you have choose to non- contactless. With that, I seek your apology on behalf Ninja Van team for this mistakes that has happen. And just to let you know, that our procedure for contactless delivery is the driver cannot failed the delivery as he need to make it completed in a day. Which is our standard procedure for contactless. And once our driver has left the parcel it is considered as a fulfilled delivery from our end. 'TLDR: 1) We made a technical error, but sorry we can't do anything about it.  2) Our drivers HAVE to complete the delivery in the same day no matter what, even if it means leaving the packages in an unsafe place OR even exposed to the weather for fragile packages.Have a nice day folks.",1,"Updated Apr 30, 2021",1,SG,Updated,Apr,4,2021

Plus when they send you your bill, you need to pay immediately unless you want your internet cut immediately after 2 minutes of not paying. They're not even trying to improve their services because they only have one competitor which is also garbage but better at fixing problems and customer service. All of their community platforms online are filled with enraged people losing their minds and complaining about how trash their service is.

I have been using tawagpinas for some years and don't have any bad experience until lately. First, there is limited access #s now, the one I used to use is no longer working (856) so I have to research another access # (732). Then dialing my family in the Philippines is tough getting a connection and when I did, a lot of times the connection disconnects in middle of conversation. Other times I have noticed too is when it rang on the other side but didn't get any connection, the minute was reduced. Hope that this recent experience will help tawagpinas improve their service.

PLDT,1.1,Bad,The worst ISP in the Philippines,"The worst ISP in the Philippines! I have called, sent emails, used their imbecile FB bot and even exchanges comments on one of their FB posts, but none of these works! I first signed up for their 25mbps DSL plan. After a year on that plan, I upgraded it to 50mbps, but still did not work for us. So when their  fibr finally arrived in 2019, I was contacted and offered to do the upgrade of our existing 2-year plan to their Fibr Home. Hoping I can finally enjoy their service, I shifted to their 100mpbs plan without them telling me that it was for an extended 3-year plan. I was under the impression that it'll only be for 24mos plan. But I was only given a week to experience 60mbps+ speed. After that, my speed went back to the 1 to less than 10 mpbs. Seriously, PLDT? It looks like they only asked us to extend our subscription without giving us what we are paying and entitled for. There was even this instance wherein they sent their technician on the field, they checked our connection. And while they were ""accordingly"" at the site where the PLDT cabinet is situated near our place. The technician was kind enough to tell me the reason why I wasn't getting the subscribed speed. Because according to him, our line was not connected or plugged in to the 100mbps circuit inside their cabinet. I don't know if that's true, but I think, they really are rampantly doing that in order for them to attract new customers. And so he put me back to that circuit and we experienced up to 98mbps for 5 days (According to Ookla). But after 5 days, our speed returned back to the 1-10mbps and sometimes 0.30mbp speed that we are normally getting from them. Aside from the low speed, it can  be observed that no day in a week that this ISP won't give you headaches because of their every now and then network lags. I also don't know if this matters as well, when they upgraded our plan, the technician only changed our router. The old copper wire weren't replaced with the fiber optic cables usually used for fibr connections. When I asked about it, I was told by their dispatched technicians that the old DSL line (copper wire) should be sufficient enough to handle the new speed. For those of you who have the knowledge about this process. Is it true that the old copper wire connected from our house to the cabinet should be sufficient to improve our upgraded plan from 25mbps to 100mbps, from DSL to fibr? Will that not really affect the speed and our connection? Coz I read that the main reason they are upgrading it from DSL to fibr, and that the speed improves a lot on fibr connection, was because of the fiber optic cables that they are using, the information (data) can travel fast using fibr optic cables, compared to the congested copper wires used in DSL connections. If they won't change our cables (copper line), I think we really won't get a good speed and the rampant connection lags wont stop. The technician left us after installing the new router and after simply saying that they do not need to change our copper line, without really attending to our concerns. According to them our old DSL (copper line), should still work well for us. I'll appreciate if a tech savvy and well experienced one, can help us answer this, so we can insist with them to replace it, coz probably that's the problem here. But nevertheless, unless PLDT change the way this company and its people does their work, they deserve nothing, but negative scores and negative reviews. And I think we should all launch one collective complaint against PLDT to the proper government offices like NTC, so we can be heard and have this rotten company be accountable to Filipino people, especially to their subscribers. I heard they launched another product called Beyond Fiber for work at Home people and for small businesses, I am hoping to hear from those who switched to this new plan and see if they already experienced improved connections.The worst part is, they are already aware of the problem, but they are not doing any action to fix it. Now, if they can't fix and if they cannot provide service. They do not have the right to ask for payment for the service they did not render. But the problem is, I think the other reviewer is right, this Company is a thief, a robber! They only want their customers money . They cannot even issue credits for the number of months that we did not use their rotten service. And I think our dear politicians who are acting like Pinoy superheroes should look into this illegal and unacceptable ways of PLDT doing their business, they must be investigated and be castigated too This company is getting richer and richer everyday out of forcibly collecting payments from their subscribers who are pissed off of their rotten services!",1,Updated 11 Aug 2020,1,PH,Updated,Aug,8,2020

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,POOF! Ninja had made parcel disappear,"The worst logistic service I have came across, they LOST my parcel. Before it came to LOST ITEM, there are a series of 'drama' from this courier service which I have experienced.1. The tracking website ETA is not accurate and kept changing.I had purchased a product online with Zalora, initially when I get the tracking number, the website shown that it had reached Ninja Van warehouse on 16th Nov (Saturday), the estimated date will be 18th - 19th Nov (still reasonable). So on 19th Nov, I checked the website again, it's been postponed to 20th (the time in their website is 9.00am - 12am). The same thing happened on the next day, it had changed to 21st, then 22nd... Well, it's understandable if the eta been postponed 1 or 2 times, but this had been a week for my case. Maybe the website is systematically changed to the next day when it is not delivered, in other words, they did not commit to a certain date for delivery.2. No one picking up calls on customer serviceI tried to call their customer service due to the incident whereby the date from website kept changing, the line was always busy.3. Email respond = tracking websiteI failed to reach them by calls, hence, I tried to email them. I had already mention my tracking number to them, however, as a standard respond, they want to get my details such as address, where it had been delivered from, what is my item of purchase etc etc. Then, the respond from them is what I can read on the tracking website ""your parcel currently on a vehicle for today delivery anytime from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM to address.."". Well, again it's a nice move from them, it is the same as what the website been mentioning, the only difference is the time till 10:00 PM, I am not sure if they had look into the case or maybe what they did is checking back through their own website.4. Non Business Hour deliveryAs my experience with other logistic service, normally, delivery time is within business hour. The address I provided is a company address, until I saw the email mentioning that it is until 10:00pm (Maybe Ninjas' working hour is different from any of us). I have emailed them to send it within business hour, and they even mention that they will try to send the parcel before 4pm, or do they really contact their delivery team or not, that is what we will never know.5. They LOST my parcelAfter a week of waiting and postponing everyday, on 25th Nov (Monday), I  found the website mentioning the delivery had been cancelled, through email contact Ninja Van, they told me that the parcel had declared lost. Well, after a series of 'drama' I have been through the past week, I am not surprised with this outcome, yet, I have never come across with LOST parcel before. Even in my working environment, we deal with lots of logistic company, I have experienced delayed, damaged goods, late delivery, but never LOST!Based on this experience I had, I will always remark that I do not want NinjaVan service when I purchase online.

We received what appeared to be a part refund but with no email to tell us about it - an amount of money was refunded back but only 40%. Have they refunded minus the taxes? Have they made a mistake? No idea as I cannot get any useful response from them. Actually managed to speak to somebody after months of trying and they said they now have a dedicated MyPAL Request Hub to deal with refunds and I needed to make a request there. Another company cover-up of their activities. I had to make separate requests for each traveller and also for seat booking fees even though they were all under the same booking. Took a lot of time and just received their standard fob-off email to each request saying the refund is in progress. I even detailed the part refund in the request text (asking if they made this payment then when is the remainder expected) so it is obvious they do not review anything and that this auto-email is sent in each case. The support staff are trained to waffle and obfuscate, it is totally unacceptable and the company effectively act as thieves or fraudsters, how they get away with it I don't know. The fact is they will probably read these reviews and just laugh and congratulate each other. For the same holiday I have already received refunds from Emirates (5 billing cycles) and Cebu Pacific (8 billing cycles although they did keep me updated along the way, were clear about the delays, indicated a timeline and actually sounded apologetic). We have had similar issues with PAL in the past (they tried to keep our taxes for refunded cancelled flights), unfortunately, they are the only airline flying to our destination and we have no other choice when visiting family (except for a 24-hr bus ride).

They have agents who call you up at home and offer you products, one of which is this Tvolution Roku which their agent offered as a free trial last August 2017. Two weeks after I received the unit, I was ready to return it because I did not find any use for it since we already had smart TVs and an Apple TV. I was shocked to learn from their customer care hotline that our account had been considered a closed transaction and that we were locked in for 3 yrs paying P199 a month! To have it disconnected, we had to pay P3800+ for early termination. This was totally unauthorized and I regret ever having given that agent a single minute of my time only to be deceived. I have filed a complaint letter early September 2017 and have repeatedly followed up, up to now December 2017, they have not terminated the service without prejudice and continue to insist that I authorized the transaction. Talk about customer satisfaction at its WORST! I find no other recourse but to file legal action against this abomination named PLDT. My only wish for this company is it’s eventual downfall and closure because they have dissatisfied thousands of customers with their arrogance and failure to deliver on their promises to provide good service to their customers.

It also says there that they attempted to deliver my item several times but failed. And so, on March 28 (the following day), they decided to just return my order to the merchant and declare a failed delivery. Sounds simple, right?Now here's the issue. First, the whole day of March 27 my family is in my house and no delivery man of any sort came. No one from LEX tried to contact us through phone. Where are they getting the guts to say that they've done every attempt to deliver my item then?Second, how lousy is the kind of service they have that on March 27 they tried to deliver and then very early on March 28, they readily declared failed delivery?

The barangay road leading up to my house can accomodate a truck or two tricycles.Above all this lousiness, I called the Lazada help center, and they are very proud to tell me that they apologize for what happened but they cannot do anything because it has already been declared ""failed delivery"". How hard is it to make a system that the customer service representative could contact a department or the courier to push through with the delivery, especially when the failure was due to the courier's obvious negligence. They also advised me to re-order the item and wait again for another 2 weeks, and it's mind-boggling that they have the face to tell me that. Are they kidding? The product is from China, and they would rather unreasonably return the product to China and make me re-order and wait for another two weeks just because it was Protocol. What an absurd protocol.Lazada has got the worst delivery and customer service ever.",1,29-Mar-19,3,PH,NULL,Mar,3,2019

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,Maybe a little bit overrated.,"This is an honest review. The transaction was very smooth however it was ruined by the quality of the flowers. I got the sunset love bouquet, the sunflowers were good BUT the roses are too dry. It is starting to get dark in color and the leaves were getting pale. The arrangement was great however I expected the best quality overall. I suspect that the flowers were arranged before the given delivery date. It is given that they are occupied because of the Valentine’s Day rush but regardless, they still should deliver the best quality possible.

The order consists of 3 android mobile phones for the online classes of my nephews and nieces. I received the items and sent them as quickly as I can to somewhere else where the users are located. I can only do so much but we were sent back to MECQ in the middle of August. LBC timeframe and all other delivery expresses are within 10-14 days before they reached the destination. But LAZADA is insisting on their return policy and not even willing to consider the ongoing situation. In the first place, money isn't easy to earn especially this time of the pandemic, your seller sent us defective items not only one but all of those 3 phones which are supposed to be for the online education of my nephews and nieces. I know you have your procedure but there's always an exemption considering the factors of the current situation. Only if you're not after your website/company gain & profit and only if you're also looking at your consumer's welfare then you will consider these issues we're pointing out as your customers.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,This is because Philippine Airlines is…,"This is because Philippine Airlines is in partnership with Justfly.com, a very unreaonable scamming, rude booking agency they should drop immediately.  We even went to Philippine Airlines office in Manilla. Philippines to resolve but received no resolution as they merely referred us back to scamming Justfly.com.The most awful scam ever! I was booking flight for 6 from Tacaban, Southern Leyte to Manilla for April 29, 2019. I purchased insurance as I always do. I am USA American citizen visiting my fiancee' in Manilla and we were in Manilla. We were going to take bus to Southern Leyte province where she is from since all flights were booked since there were 2 earthquakes many were cancelled. We wanted to fly back from Tacaban to Manilla so I could catch my flight back to USA. I checked everything 3 times before hitting confirm.Then the email confirmation had the flight for 6 from Manilla to Tacaban on April 29, 2019, the opposite of what I entered. When I contacted Justfly.com to correct it, they said I needed to cancel flight and rebook. I had insurance so I thought no problem, right? WRONG! Justfly charged me $450 USD for ""administrative fee and wanted it on a separate credit card!!! I can understand a small admin fee, but $450.00 USD or PH 22,500???!!! So I called Philippine Airlines who Justfly booked our flights with. They could not help and referred .me back to Justfly.com. i called my bank Wells Fargo to put a stop pay and get my money back to my account asap as I was now low on funds. I reported it to Fraud department but takes 7 - 10 business days and the could not do anything in the meantime. They all agreed it was a scam since I paid the airfares and $110 USD for insurance, then Justfly.com charged an additional $450.and neither Justfly com or Philippine airlines would do nothing to use the airfares I paid taken out of my account to rebook another flight! They were very mean and uncooperative! I also went to US Embassy in Manilla, Philippines and repirted to US Better Business Bureau. I would give ZERO or Negative stars if this would allow me to. Must say this is a very well orchestrated planned SCAM. We have been and will continue to tell everyone about how terrible Justfly.com is and how rude they are while scamming and ripping off hard working Americans!!!",1,2-May-19,2,US,NULL,May,5,2019

I mean, for an application, how would we have an account number? It's so ridiculous. I tried calling them via 171 but guess what? To be able to get an agent, you need to provide either account number or service reference number. I provided the reference number of my application but the operator kept saying it's invalid. SO RIDICULOUS. So i ended up reaching out to them through twitter, AND THEY STRAIGHT UP TOLD ME THAT MY APPLICATION GOT CANCELED.

Ninja Van,1.2,Bad,Ninja Van is a Nightmare!,"This is my second encounter with Ninja Van and it ended like the first one - a disaster. Parcel was sent out by the seller on 17 May and I received an SMS from NV that delivery will be made on 19 May. I was home the entire day but parcel never showed up. Called customer service at 8.28 p.m. and they basically told me they couldn't do anything. An hour later, I received a call from someone, who claimed to be the IC of NV deliveries made in my area, and he told me the sob story of how overworked NV delivery people are and that it was impossible for his driver to deliver more than 400 parcels on 19 May. Therefore, he proposed that my delivery be made by 8.30 a.m. on 20 May. He also said that NV customer service is of no help because it's based in Malaysia, not Singapore. When the call ended, I checked the website and realised that they had sneakily updated the system as such: Delivery is unsuccessful - The customer requested for a change in the date/time of delivery. Imagine my horror! I was furious and texted the IC to set the record straight that I've never requested for a change in the delivery schedule and that they should not use their customers as a convenient excuse for their incompetency. Unsurprisingly, I never received a reply.Part 2: The next morning, I checked my phone for replies. There was none. I repeated my message and went about my daily routine. At 8.38 a.m., there was still no sign of my package. I immediately called the IC and he had to take a few minutes to recall who I was. He claimed that his delivery guy had left with the parcel at 7.30 a.m. and sounded surprised that I had not received my package. He promised to give the delivery guy a call to find out what was going on. By then, I was fuming mad and hung up on him. Half an hour later, I still did not receive any form of reply from the IC and so I called him but he refused to answer my phone calls. Like a bad break-up, I made 36 missed calls and he just refused to pick them up. I never heard from him since. It's 3.36 p.m. now and I still have no parcel.So yup, Ninja Van should be the last resort for any form of delivery service.

Upon calling and ""investigation"" (some reviews mentioned 3-5 working days, mine took 2 mins to check), turns out items were lost at the warehouse and no attempt of delivery was actually made. Beats me who marked the item as delivered or how it got marked as delivered? As this order is part of a two part shipment, refund was made for missing items but lost out on free gift from minimum spend. By the way, it took more than 2 weeks for ninjavan to inaccurately mark my items as delivered (26/11/21) then declared as lost.

As I can't just leave my 2 little kids at home and go downstairs to collect the parcel and my husband is working in his office, so nobody can help me to collect the parcel.But the NinjaVan driver refused to do so even I asked properly. He want me to understand him, then who want to understand me?What if anything happen to the 2 little kids at home when I go downstairs to collect the parcel from him?He said he can do reschedule for the next day. Whats the point? Tomorrow the kids are still with me and I still cant go downstairs to collect. Why your driver so funny?I get mad and he just told me ""you want to angry nevermind cos our phone got recorded"". Wah, like want to threaten me.Seriously, so many times I asked this kind of help from other courier service companies also they willing to help.

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,This is the worst Valentine's Day ever…,"This is the worst Valentine's Day ever because of our experience with this flower store!I received a bouquet of two dozens of red roses together with a chocolate bouquet, and an Elizabeth Arden fragrance mist on February 13 from my boyfriend in the United States. He ordered them online at FlowerStore.ph  as a Valentine's Day present. They arrived on time. The chocolate bouquet and the fragrance mist were okay. But to my dismay, they sent me wilted flowers which looked nothing like how they were advertised (with baby's breath among other things). What I received were just wilted red roses bundled up together. I called the store right away to ask for a replacement. They apologized and told me that they are sending a replacement that night. I waited until 11:00pm but no one showed up to deliver the flowers. They did not even send me a text or a note to tell me that they will not be able to deliver the flowers anymore. I even sent them text messages as well as DMs on Instagram. They left all my DMs on read. So I called them on Sunday morning, Valentine's day.I was very angered and disappointed at how poorly and unprofessional they handled customer complaints. First, they told me that they cannot deliver the flowers because their schedule is full. I told them that they should find a way since they promised to replace it the night before. Then they told me that the red roses are out of stock and that they will send me a different kind of flowers. At this point, I had to ask the cost of the Grand Gesture bouquet which I initially received and they told me that they are sending me cheaper flowers and that they will just refund the price difference. I was so disappointed and frustrated and I talked to the manager and just demanded for a refund. I did not want their flowers or any of their excuses anymore. They ruined my day and my boyfriend's as well. I had to make so many calls to them and no one even called me back to make things right.After sending them emails and calling their customer support for the refund, my boyfriend finally got his money back. But still, it already caused us too much stress and disappointment on that very special occasion.This flower store does not live up to what they claim as Philippine's #1 flower store.

They are apathetic, rude and condescending. They lack accountability. No empathy or should I say a “no fcks given” attitude.

If you have not received either of these two, then you can assume your chat support agent did not care about helping you at all.UPDATE as of 11:12PM.No one has sent me an update yet despite their on chat promises and I have not received a single transcript and case number for the three (3) contacts I made today, Jan. 7, 2022. Frustrating and infuriating.UPDATE as of 12:42 AM - Jan. 8, 2022.An agent named Meg disconnected the chat again after I asked for a case number. She doesn’t intend to create one I guess. See? This is entirely normal to them. No sales invoice assistance and 5k worth of company reimbursement gone. A waste of money.",1,"Updated Jan 7, 2022",2,PH,Updated,Jan,1,2022

People have warned me and tried to stop me from ordering from this shop, but I took a risk. I only work as a call center agent and I am on a no work, no pay scheme given the crisis that we have right now. I bought flowers worth $38 or 1899 pesos for my mom for mother's day. I'm spending what's left on my card to buy her flowers and this is what I get? I understand that you could have a skeletal workforce with you given the situation, but don't they have the decency to reply to any of my texts? Calls? Emails? Chats? Comments? Instagram DMs? They constantly update their page on FB and instagram feed and stories but you can't let me know what's going on with my payment? Why haven't I received a call? A text? Anything? People have been posting that your shop is a scam and I want to believe that that is untrue but I'm very frustrated to be placed in this position.

The flowers and chocolate were not delivered my fiance and her mother had to go to the office where they refused to give my fiance her gift because she did not have a identification! I navigate me to the website and entered chat with a girl named Christine I told her to change the recipient name on the order! Well 10 - 15 minutes later Christine Sends me a automated message stating that they do not handle orders after they have been purchase. So I sent them several emails asking them to change the recipient name but I never got a response! I went back to the website entered chat with Christine again I told her or more less demanded they change the recipient's name! She did not even respond but sent another automated message stating the previous! I sent her a message and told her to cancel my damn order. She then responded that the name would be changed!

But according to these crooks the item was delivered to me, at that address.  SO what the hell are Ninja Van doing?  Probably nothing.

Entrego,1.4,Bad,WORST!!!! IF THERE IS 0 STAR THAT'S WHAT THEY DESERVED!,"UPDATE:  January 6, 2021, I still have not received my package.  ENTREGO said it was returned to the sender but when asking GLOBE they also cannot provide a clear answer on where my package is.  Likely, seriously, WHAT THE HELL?When I found out my package from Globe will be delivered by this company I started searching for reviews and found too much negative feedbacks on their service.  Unfortunately, I got to experience their poor service as well.  My package from Globe was supposed to be delivered on December 18th but I got a text message from Globe that it was moved to be on the 19th so even if I'm in the province already, I needed to go back to Las Pinas to personally receive it.  Come December 19 I got a text message from Entrego saying that my package will be delivered and in all fairness, it arrived around 4:00 PM.  Unfortunately though, my package (which has my name on it so it is SURELY MINE) came with the renewal form that I need to sign with a different name on it and so in the end the package was not released to me.  I contacted Globe and they reached out to me saying that they have forwarded the correct documents so the delivery of my package could proceed but I DID NOT RECEIVE anything from this company whatsoever after that failed delivery except another text message yesterday (December 22) that they will attempt to deliver it but then immediately after another text message came saying it was not delivered and upon checking on their website it can be seen that they have tried to deliver it 3 times and so it reached the allowable number of delivering the package when in fact they only tried to deliver it once.  What the hell is wrong with you people?  Now I understand why the customers are questioning why Globe still chooses you to be their courier.  Now, December 23, almost 3:00 PM, there's still nothing from Entrego and I am going back to the province tomorrow (I should have gone home yesterday) and will not be back until January 3rd, like WHAT THE HELL.

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,Never again will I order from this shop! Ever!,"UPDATE: 21 MAY 2021I have officially lodged a complaint to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) against flowerstore.ph. Until to this date, I HAVE to follow up my refund every single day and they sometimes would NOT even reply. They absolutely have the worst customer service. This is based on the experience I had to endure just because I bought a surprise gift for my mother on Mother's Day - one that they FAILED to deliver.I placed 2 orders the 27th of April 2021 for the Mother's Day which happens to be 9th of May. I did an advance order so they could sort everything out and that they could deliver on or before the 9th of May.The 2 orders comprised of 1 provincial delivery and 1 Metro Manila delivery.6th of MayI received a tracking number from Ninjavan that my order has been picked up. I was happy because it meant my order for the provincial delivery will be delivered. 7th of May According to the tracking website provided by Flowerstore.ph for Ninjavan, my provincial order in transit. No updates since then.9th of MaySince morning of this day, I have been anxious because there are no updates in the tracking site and the customer service from the facebook page kept telling me ""rest assured it will be delivered today"". Metro manila bound order - delivered. No tracking, no notifications. I just found out it was delivered.Antipolo City bound order - nothing. No news. Just broken promises of it being delivered on the 9th of May. Past 4pm, I have been in constant stress and anxiety. As someone living in Canada, I trusted this shop to deliver a surprise gift for my mother on that one special day meant for our mothers. But no. No deliveries were made even when I ordered last April 27, 2021. While I understand that there may be high volume of orders, the shop SHOULD KNOW not to keep getting orders they are UNABLE to fulfill. They did not deliver my surprise gifts for my mother.10th of May 2021I told them I just want a refund because I decided to order from another shop. At first, they were hesistant. They said that they cannot do a refund until I received my order. I told them firmly no. They have to refund me now because I am done with this store. They told me they started the process of refund and that it takes 2-7days.You see, at this point, I DO NOT TRUST THIS FLOWERSTORE.PH anymore. I KEPT asking for a proof that they started the refund. But NOTHING. They are not sending any proof that the refund process started. At this time of writing, they are still lying to my face regarding my refund. Until they show me a proof, I do not trust a word they tell me.Beware! They hide/delete comments and posts on their FB page especially about complaints.Update: 10th of May 12:38pm Manila timeThey blocked me on their Facebook page. I do not mind at all. Just please send me my refund and that's it.Update: 13th of May 12:30pm Manila timeI have sent several emails to the email address provided regarding my update. They have not responded to me despite of the numerous emails sent. Until today, I am suffering from anxiety because of this.",1,"Updated May 22, 2021",1,CA,Updated,May,5,2021

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,VERY BAD SERVICE!!!,"VERY BAD SERVICE!!!This happened yesterday, February 14. My fiancé planned to surprise me with your flowers & chocolates. Paid the amount of php2895 online via his card last Tuesday. Come yesterday, delivery indicated was 9am-6pm. He suggested to have it delivered in the office between 9am-4pm because my work ends at 4pm. And we have hotel & restaurant reservations to get to after work. Delivery was late, they made us wait ( so yes, no longer a surprise ). I let it pass since I don’t want to ruin the moment, I tried to understand the store because I know it’s a peak day for them too since it’s valentine’s day. However, flowers came, box is damaged, flowers are too dry and already turning black AND THE CHOCOLATES WERE NOT IN IT. The store forgot the chocolates! They made us wait, and that’s what we get? Good thing I opened it infront of your delivery guy and showed him what’s inside. The chocolates were missing. Oh wow!I called your store, which was so hard to reach! A guy answered and gave compromises. They told me that they would re-deliver next day, I told them there’s no work on weekends and I’ll be in the hotel. They said they can send it to the hotel TODAY. I don’t have a choice so I said sure. He said they’ll be making it a priority. Told them we’ll be leaving the hotel by 12pm, for check out. They promised to deliver it before check out time. But then again, they broke their promise! I’m on my way home now, no flowers, no chocolates, I have been calling, texting their number, I have been messaging you on facebook, but it’s just seen. Your phone blocked my number and can’t reach you anymore. I am very disappointed with your service. I am not even getting updates on what happened. No explanation. We have been a loyal customer to your store, and you do this to me? Very sad. It’s like you don’t value your clients, and the money they invest to your products. You’re even ignoring me. I have attached photos of proofs. If I don’t hear any actions from you, I’ll make sure this won’t pass. You could’ve been honest to me, but NO. You lied and lied.",1,15-Feb-20,1,PH,NULL,Feb,2,2020

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,Highly recommended for excellent service and gift bundles,"Very good and professional to transact with this company. I ordered a flower bouquet and gift as a surprise to my sister and they have a very good choice of products and bundles to choose from. My brother-in-law and my sister loved The Giant Teddy Super Bundle I bought from them - super worth it. I cannot find another store with a bundle containing a combination of very good quality products. Being based in Cainta, Rizal, there are flower shops near us but I chose to book my order with this company because of lower price and excellent quality. Kudos to the company for its innovative range of flower arrangements and product combinations, in addition to its excellent customer service (from inquiry to order management and delivery)! Experience-wise, I definitely recommend this store to my friends and to those who want to surprise their special/loved ones.",5,13-Oct-20,1,PH,NULL,Oct,10,2020

And when delivered, it was delivered wrongly to my neighbour. And the hotline dares to tell me that they will deliver to neighbour when no one is at home. What rubbish. I was waiting all day at home and doorbell was not even pressed. When neighbour realised he collected the wrong parcel, he thought it was his parcel, he came over to return and based on timing, i was just sitting next to my main door doing work. There wasnt even a knock. Obviously a wrong delivery. Not first time some more. The hotline is as good as nothing. Just wasting time contacting and waiting. They will do nothing at all.

It was great on the first day, no lag what so ever and we had 80+ download speed and upload speed which made us really happy. I could play valorant while my sister and mother were in zoom meetings. But on the second day we experienced a bit of lag. From 80+ mbps it turned into just 30 - 50 mbps. The third day It was really bad, it was still 30 - 50 mbps but now I couldn't even play even though I was the only one using the internet at that time. When we reported this problem many times, they just kept saying the same thing which is just rest your modem for 5 mins. We've been waiting for months to get our pldt wifi migrated to fiber, we kept calling everyday so they could give us a ticket of our follow ups, and when we got fiber they wouldn't entertain our questions or complains.

The flight times got changed so many times we had to wait until a couple of days before to find our the actual time of our flight to Cebu. Then we checked in online 24 hours in advance. We are traveling with 3 suitcases so we tried to buy an additional bag online. Was not even an option. Tried to call the customer service number with no success. Showed up at the airport only to be told that we would have to pay $176 US for that 1 bag since we didn’t buy it online prior to the flight. Our tickets were only $166 ea. I argued with the person at the counter since the website showed that an extra bag from Taiwan to Philippines was $100, but she charged us per KG for an 18.5 kg bag. They even took the tags off of our other 2 bags since I was refusing to pay $176. She figured we were just going to walk away and lose everything we paid for these flights. So I just stood there and finally she reduced the price to $155 which she must have plucked out the air. I still tried to argue that we should have only paid $100.

So I waited and when I asked for an update around 7PM, they said I CANCELLED THE ORDER. I was like seriously?! I never told them to cancel it so it’s pretty obvious that they are the ones that cancelled it and are putting the blame on me. So afterwards I asked for the refund and behold, despite their promise earlier to refund me ASAP, they told me to wait for 2 to 10 business days! I was screaming inside out of anger. They won’t admit their shortcomings and will instead put all of the blame on the customer. I don’t even know if I’ll ever get the refund. This shop is a SCAM. I don’t recommend to order from this place if you want a smooth and legit transaction. I will never order from this place and I hope this shop will run out of business.

Philippine Airlines,1.4,Bad,Worst flight experience I've ever had,"Worst flight experience I've ever had. Hong Kong to The Philippines:Arrive 2hrs early and the flight is cancelled (Hong Kong to Lon Via Philippines) and the staff had no information for the first 30 minutes. Fortunately there were 2 other people flying the same route and a solid dozen flying the first leg. We finally get rebooked onto a different airline, based in a different terminal. Here begins the journey. After a rush across Hong Kong airport we arrive and the new airline needs to update their system firmware to on-board us. This takes a serious amount of time and how it was handled did not instill confidence but we eventually are on the plane, setting off slightly late. The actual flight (NOT Philippines airlines) was rather nice, a short haul with everything it needed. Philippines to London:We land at the wrong terminal and have to clear immigration & customers to then rush 30 mins across the airport to then go through passport control before we can board our original flight to London on Philippines airlines. The PA flight to London was rather long as expected but did not include any food or drinks, instead opting for high payment prices & shortages of drinks (alco and non-alcho) and food. The flight didn't include any blankets or pillows from what I can remember (I'm sure you could rent them for a cost). This was a stressful experience from start to end, at not much cheaper than other options, certainly not cheap enough to account for the terrible quality. The worst part of this is that they couldn't tell us why the flight was cancelled and did not warn any of us in advance, despite having all of our contact details. They instead opted to wait until we tried to check in to highlight the problem. We were once told that the flight was cancelled because of an issue the DAY BEFORE but then told us this was incorrect, which felt more as if they realised us knowing they'd known for over 12 hours and done nothing looked bad on them. I would argue that there wasn't enough of us passengers to financially justify anything but putting us all on the half empty competitors flight. NB. It's worth noting the actual staff were actually really friendly and professional despite the chaos but it felt more as if their ability to help resolve the issues was more experience with things going wrong regularly.",1,28-Oct-17,1,GB,NULL,Oct,10,2017

CS is very important as this is where clients can get the feedbacks/answers they need especially with regards to the “paid” orders. also, in Batangas branch, some delivery man only rely on what others say. for example someone told them this specific location is under ‘lockdown’. without doing an attempt, they will not push through with the delivery and put “location under lockdown” in the status and what’s worse is they bring the parcel back to manila. aren’t they supposed to RE-DELIVER it? I went to the hub, and someone gave a number of the OIC. she told me processing might take up to 1 week so I waited. exactly 1wk when I tried contacting the OIC, and he just keeps on telling me “you’re not the only one with pending” ... like ??? I don’t have anything to do with other’s order. I just want my order - which is already pending for almost a month now - to be delivered. that’s all.

I've placed my order at around 5am (24-May-2018, Dubai time); and they've called my Mother about 3pm my time that same day... but that's kinda evening back home.. but man! they are so great to deliver it after an hour calling her.. so Yeah!  this flower service - is RELIABLE!  and i will, from now on.. will send gifts to my Momma using their services again and again, whenever I want my mother to feel special!  I am just so grateful to them.. they made my Mother so happy on her birthday.. if only there's an option here to upload the flowers she received, will do! PS:  for those who had bad experiences, perhaps it was a Logistics problem or some unavoidable situational cases; we can't judge the services of a Co. if it is not easy to reach one's location.

PawnHero & Marketplace,4.2,Great,SCAMMERS!,oh my god this pawnhero is totally a big SCAM!!! Never ever put your trust in this site! pls im telling you based on my experienced. I trusted to gave my phone because im really in need of money. When they were about to get the phone theres so many calls you can get. Then in there site it told me that my loan was approved then the messenger named Mario Mendez took my phone at 2 pm. Then i received a call from a woman then she said whats your apple id and password??? i already signed out before i gave it to them but they were forcing to log into my account! Its obvious that you shouldn’t do anything to a pawned phone! especially passwords or accounts on apple are confidential! unless you have the thought of not giving it back! What was more intriguing was when the same day i gave my phone and keep on calling me to give my password after how many hours by 8 pm they told me that they can’t pawned my cp! And its for return! The more doubting part the number they used to called previously cannot be reached! Then i went to their site immediately to find more phone numbers in able for me to call them then still no one was available to answer me they all changed there numbers right away. There fb account was fake its not answering just machine operated on messenger. Damn! you are all SCAMMERS! Look at it guys pls? i will report this to nbi next week i will surely do it. their office address posted on their site is always changing even the phone numbers i believed the guy whos picking up our phones is maybe the husband of that woman whos faking to be  a call center in the office! I will end all your cyber criminal acts!  Ngayon d ko magamit phone ko gago kayo!!! Pinapalamon nyo sa pamilya nyo puro pang loloko!  Sinauli nyo kasi d nyo kaya pakinabangan! dahil secured!

Flowerstore.ph,4.0,Great,worst experience ever,"worst experience ever. pre-ordered for mother's day 2 items. i was already frustrated while chatting with the rep because i originally wanted to have 2 dedication cards for each item, one for my sister, and one for my mom. they said they cannot do that because rule is one card per transaction, so if i ordered 5 flowers in one transaction, only one card is given. (okay seriously dumbest thing ive ever heard, sorry for being rude) i asked if i can purcahse one dedication card for the other flower and they said they cant do that. 🤦🏻‍♀️ okay so i let it go. Mothers day came and only 1 out of 2 items was delivered. My sister insisted on delivering the missing item that day but they said they have heaps of deliveries so it cant be done. all they can do was say sorry. I was actually still very patient about this. they told us they will deliver it first thing the next day. tomorrow afternoon came and the flowers is still nowhere to be found. This time I was really mad. Called customer service and insisted on getting it delivered that day. (sorry to the rep that i spoke to for being mean, i just.. i cant even... so frustrating)anyway, my advice to flowerstore.ph- only accept deliveries you can handle. - dont just blindly take the money from your customers, and then provide the crappiest service. you guys dont care, seriously.",1,10-May-21,1,AU,NULL,May,5,2021
